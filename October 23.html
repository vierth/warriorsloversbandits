				<section><h1>Warriors, Lovers, and Adventurers</h1>
					<p>October 23rd</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Grades</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>I put up a bunch of comments and grades for you earlier this morning, and I'm really sorry for falling behind on this. Overall everyone is doing really well in this class and I've been quite happy about your essays. I hope it is been fairly evident from my grading, but I did want to talk to you about how I see particular scores so you know how to interpret the grades you are getting, because I know that they can be a bit anxiety inducing. Just so you know, I got plenty of Bs when I was in college (in fact, I got a C in freshman year Chinese).
				<br>
				<br>
				I see an 85 as essentially exactly meeting expectations. There might be some gramatical and stylistic issues, but the contents are generally correct with no major misunderstandings.
				<br>
				<br>
				Below 85 and down to an 80 it is still generally within expectations but might show more grammatical issues or be difficult to follow and contain misundertanding and mistakes. 
				<br>
				<br>				
				Below 80 represents passable, but with significant issues.
				<br>
				<br>
				Below 70 is unacceptable (doesn't come close to meeting the word requirement, completely off topic, plagerized, etc.)
				<br>
				<br>
				85 to 89 are good essays contain fewer stylistic/gramatical issues that draw clear connections between all components of the essay.
				<br>
				<br>
				90 to 93 are excellent essays generally free of gramatical issues and are clear without being too wordy. One tendency I've noted is to use more words than are necessary and to use passive voice. These aren't technically gramatical problems, but they do detract from the experience and a 90 and above will be less prone to these issues.
				<br>
				<br>
				94 and above are exceptional essays that present clear links between all parts of the reflection (that is it is clear why all parts of the reflection are present) and provide clear evidence for all statements made and are clearly thought out and presented. Free of issues of style and gramatical issues, they generally make an innovative or unexpected argument or presentation (or if not innovative, very well thought out and presented)

				<section><h2>Next Week</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>No class, I am in Taiwan giving a talk. Also, no reflective essay for next week</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Play so Far</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>I want to get your impressions of this. 
						<br>
						<br>	
				What do you like about it? 
				<br>
				<br>
				What don't you like about it? 
				<br>
				<br>
				How do you see this in relation to the other works taht we've discussed?</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Book the Second</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Let's read this "Untiled" section together on page 189.
						<br>
						<br>
				What function do you see this playing? Why do you think the author might have included this?
				<br>
				<br>
				Let's talk about the last two of these stanzas. What do you think of this discussion of intertextuality? Dharma Wit wasn't the one who saved the day?? And waht of this game of go?
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0AAFhx3RmA'>Zither 古琴</a></h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Zither's play an important role in the romance drawn here, as an image of refinement.
						<br>
						<br>
				Let's take a look at this performance.
				<br>
				<br>
				What do you think of this? What sorts of feelings does it evoke?
				<br>
				<br>
				These wer egenerally made out of Wutong wood, whcih in turn imbued the trees themselves with a sense of refinement and vague sadness (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmiana_simplex#/media/File:Firmiana_simplex3.jpg)
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Play 3: Act 1</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>
				Can anyone summarize what happens in this act?
				<br>
				<br>
				It opens on page 191 with a conversation between Oriole and Crimson (read)
				<br>
				<br>
				Rhinoceros honr (192)
				<br>
				<br>
				Student Zhang hopes to see Oriole again, and has told the abbot to pass word that he is ill to entice her to see him.
				<br>
				<br>
				We see another long recap of what has happened. Do you think you could pick up any random scene int his play and get a sense for what is happening?
				<br>
				<br>
				There is a very interesting role holes play in Chinese literature as ways of illicitly moving information from one space to another. Let's look at page 193 "Crimson speaks:..." What do you make of this?
				<br>
				<br>
				She agrees to pass a letter on to Oriole, but note that Crimson is illiterate, so she asks tudent Zhang to read what he has written, and he does (195 "I gogng, with a hundred obeisances")
				<br>
				<br>
				They engage in witty reparte and she agrees to give it to Oriole, and he calls it a marriage charm.
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Act 2</h2><aside class='notes'>
				This act is focused primarily on Oriole recieving the letter from Student Zhang.
				<br>
				<br>
				Read oening page (199)
				<br>
				<br>
				Read section where oriole reads the letter (200). What do you make of this interaction?
				<br>
				<br>
				Crimson points out that Zhang isnt' looking well (201), and when Oriole suggests he speak with a doctor Crimson says "To stabilize his illness He'll have to sweat beads of romance." Oriole threatens Crimson, which is a common dynamic between the two. What are your thoguhts on this?
				<br>
				<br>
				Crimson explicitly lays out her promsied role as a go between on page 202 at the tp "Because of you he is coupled in dreams..." Thoughts?
				<br>
				<br>
				On page 203 in the midst of a song suite, Crimson imitates Oriole (Speaking as female lead)...
				<br>
				<br>
				Top of 204: You almost pulled your mother into the crime...
				<br>
				<br>
				Crimson reports that Oriole was not receptive and hands him the letter she wrote on 205 (and here is where Oriole's illiteracy comes into lay again). "I have no way to explain..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Student Zhang starts to make plans for the rendevous and laments the slow passing of time. 207: Alas everything has its alloted fate.
				<br>
				<br>
				208: Very end: Thanks to heaven and earth
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Act 3</h2><aside class='notes'>
				209: Read opening. What do you think of Crimson's role i setting up this affair?
				<br>
				<br>
				The tension builds with Crimson's aid at the top of 211: Sister you stand here by the rocker... Thoughts on this? What do you make or the comical nature of this?
				<br>
				<br>
				Crimson insists that he jump over the wall rather than be let in.
				<br>
				<br>
				HE jumps across the wayu (212 "Student acts out jumping across the wall")
				<br>
				<br>
				213: "Student Chang where's that big mouth of yours" Thoughts?
				<br>
				<br>
				Crimson runs interference for Zhang and smooths the interaction but Zhagn blames here 214 "Male lead speaks facing a ghost door"
				<br>
				<br>
				215: Missy you're the death of me...
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Act 4</h2><aside class='notes'>
				216: Read the opening. note the medical nature of the discussion
				<br>
				<br>
				217: "Male lead enters and speaks..."
				<br>
				<br>
				218: Crimson again immates Oriole "Crimson speaks in imitation of the female lead..."
				<br>
				<br>
				219: The madam ordered me to come and ask...
				<br>
				<br>
				220: Male lead acts out looking at it...
				<br>
				<br>
				220: Don't let idle matters torture your bosom... clouds and rain is a common metaphor for sex. what do you think of this change of heart?
				<br>
				<br>
				222: "Because of tonights exchange"
