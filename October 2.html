				<section><h2>Leadup to 81</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>In the previous chapter they find a spirit disguised as a woman tied to a tree in a forest. Tripitika cannot see that she is in fact a spirit, but Monkey can. T wants to rescue her, but Monkey tries to dissuade him. They do rescure her, but Monkey is able to prevent her from harming the Tang monk. Something to keep in mind here is the nature of women in Journey to the West. We saw a lot of this last time, but they tend to be seen as enemies who are out to sully the heros (and that is the focus of the conversation in chapter 80). Sanzang is pure because he has never "spilled any of his primal esssence" but this spirit was hoping to change that. They eventually arrive at an abbey where they are fed by the local monks. This is when we get to Chapter 81.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 81</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
				The monks hope to all get a glimpse of the girl: what do you think of how buddhist monks are presented in this novel? Why do you think they aren't devoute but are rather mired in wordly desires?
				<br>
				<br>			
				They have brought a woman to an abbey, so they need to figure out where she should stay. 
				87: "abbot, said tripitika..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Everything passes as normal that night, but when it is time to resume the journey in the morning they can't because Tripitika isn't feeling well. There is a conversation here about why that is the case:
				88: "I don't know why..."
				What do you think of this? What do you think of the understanding of how the body reacts to its environment?
				<br>
				<br>
				After a few days T starts to ask about a few things. First, he asks if the woman they broght with them has been fed, and Monkey scoffs and says "why worry about that when you are also sick." T responds "Indeed! Indeed! Fetch my writing implements"
				What do you think of this, given T's description as a person of unending compassion?
				<br>
				<br>
				There is an interesting dynamic between T and Monkey that we should think about. When T asks for writing implements, Monkey gets them, but then insists T tell him what he is going to write. 89: "Thta's easy... tell me a little of its contents and then you may write." What do you think about this?
				<br>
				<br>
				Let's also take a look at the contents of the letter aimed at the emperor: 89: "Three times"
				What does this letter tell us about ritual and Confucian orthodoxy? How does this relate to the mystical Buddhism we've seen throughout the story?
				<br>
				<br>
				Monkey's reaction to the letter is to laugh and then to say "What Yama king dares make the decision" to kill you! He then says he would travel to the underworld to prevent this from happening.
				<br>
				<br>
				Zhu bajie has a very different reaction to this: 90: "walking up to them, "
				<br>
				<br>
				Monkey argues this was bound to happen and it is part of the pennace the monk must pay.
				What do you make of these different reactions? What does this tell us about the characters?
				<br>
				<br>
				90: "you wouldn't know about this..." 
				<br>
				<br>
				T starts to feel better and requests some water, and when Monkey goes to fetch it we are introduced to the main conflict of the chapter. 91: "Venerable Father said another priest... (second instance)"
				<br>
				<br>
				91: "On hearing this..." What do you think of Monkey's reaction here?
				<br>
				<br>
				92: "don't believe the honesty of the honest..." What does this mean?
				<br>
				<br>
				The monks are worried that Monkey will just roust whatever this beast is if he tries to attack it, and then warn him that they are simple monks, and they provide a description of what this means. 92: "they find knives... to chant Buddha's name". What does this say about how they live their lives
				<br>
				<br>
				93: "we are not able to tame tigers..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Monkey of course argues that he can take care of it, and the monks agree but warn him he shoudl be taking care of T first and foremost. The water makes T feel better (and he refers to it as if it were an elixer) and even requests rice.
				<br>
				<br>
				They start to make plans for departure, and T is worried about the time lost, and Monkey says you can't think of it that way. But if we leave tomorrow, I need to take care of a spirit. T, like the monks, is concerned about him failing. 94: "o disciple..." What do you make of these constant warnings?
				<br>
				<br>
				Once T discovers the monster is eating people in the monostary, he agrees to let Monkey fight it. Monkey changes himself into the form of a young priest about 12 to 13 years old and goes off.
				<br>
				<br>
				On page 97 we see the nature of the beast revealed, and once again, women are presented as the enemy: "When the wind subsided..."
				<br>
				<br>
				We can see how the enticement happens on page 98: "They put their arms around each other..."
				<br>
				<br>
				A fight ensues and this is a bit like many of those we have already seen in which Monkey is stronger than his enemy, but they are still fairly evenly matched... Eventually, she engages in subterfuge:
				100: "Lawless wench..." What do you think of this?
				We haven't talked about this yet in class, but the act of removing ones shoe would be EXTREMELY sexual.
				<br>
				<br>
				As monkey is fighting the shoe, she abducts Tripitika and runs off. Monkey discovers this and then threatens to kill Zhu Bajie and Sha monk who should ahve been guarding T. They talk some sense into him and after some investigation they discover that the women monkey was fighting is the one they rescued in Chapter 80. Monkey asks around the local spirits and discovers where the woman hs fled to.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the following chapter they of course rescure Tripitika.
			</aside>

			<section><h2>Chapter 85</h2><aside class='notes'>
				This next chapter brings us to a new kingdom with new strange rules. In this particular place, the king has instructed that all buddhist monks be killed because of a karmic hatred of Buddhists. He has vowed to kill 10,000 and he has already killed (conveniently) 9996 of them (only four to go!). Monkey wants to go through (even though Guanyin has just warned them). Eventually they arrive at inn where they discuss food fairly extensively. They hide that they are buddhists by first requesting a feast with meat, but then asking for vegetarian food contriving a story about nto eating meat on certain days. Monkey comes up with a plan, and he shaves the heads of everyone at court.
				<br>
				<br>
				T is scared they will be caught, so they hide in a cupboard at the inn, and this eventually stolen by bandits and then recovered, so the adventerurs find themselves about to come face to face with the king.
				<br>
				<br>
				We learn that they dare not slaughter monks after losing their hair: 156: "o lord..."
				What do you make of this? This is confucian, one should generally not cut hair because it was bestowed to you by your ancestors. Shaving your head is then an important symbolic gesture of leaving the secular world behind.
				This is also why the tonsure in the Qing dynasty was so controversial...
				<br>
				<br>
				T is of course terrified, not realizing that Monkey has taken care of things already.
				<br>
				<br>
				Zhu bajie, of course throws a wrench into things: 157: "when the subjects asked the king..." What do you think of Zhu's actions here? what does this tell us about him as a buddhist?
				<br>
				<br>
				After things calm down a bit, the king asks why T is in the cupboard, and T explains he is from the Tang empire and they had heard about hte vow to slaughter monks. The king explains 157: "The venerable master..." What do you make of this heirarchical talk? why is the tang govt treated this way?
				<br>
				<br>
				They get their rescript signed and they can safely journey on their way. 158: "after thanking pilgrim..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Here we turn to a new story. What do you think of this practice of breaking to new things int he middle of this chatper. does this comport with how you think a novel should be written? what effect does it have on you as the reader? How would you compare this with Romance of the THree Kingdoms?
				<br>
				<br>
				Eventually they find themselves in the mountains facing a new threat: an unnatural wind and fog. 161:"Chucking to himself..." What do you think of this?
				<br>
				<br>
				He entice zhu to go forward saying there is food, and of course there isn't. 162: "Chuckling to himself..." Zhu gets trapped and is fighting the local monsters
				<br>
				<br>
				Eventually Monkey chuckles to himself and the Sha monk asks him what is going on, so he explains 165: "Zhu bajie is truely idiotic"
				<br>
				<br>
				He goes off and finds that Zhu is fairly evenly matched. He helps out a bit and Zhu is able to return but it is clear he has not been gathering grass for the horse, but instead he has been fighting. 
				<br>
				<br>
				They decide to continue on their journey and act as if they are on military maneouvers
				<br>
				<br>
				But one of the monsters recognizes Monkey and sets out a plan to kindnap T. Why? well 168: "he happens to be a monk..."
				<br>
				<br>
				They will ghet three monsters to appear like the leader and they will distract mokney, zhu, and sha, and then the leader will kidnap T. In the end, of course, this works.
				<br>
				<br>
				They cant' eat him immediately, because they need to be sure the party moves on. Plus if they wait a few days he will be cleaner to eat. we discover they already havesomeone: 172: "As tears streamed down his face..." What do you make of this interaction?
