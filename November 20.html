				<section><h1>Warriors, Lovers, and Adventurers</h1>
					<p>November 18th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Television and Movies</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Today I just want to go through and take a look at som eof the many different adaptations of the texts we've looked at to give you a sense of how actively people are still thinking about these works, and to show you the mode in which most people would have been exposed to them in the first place. I should warn you that I will not be comprehensive here, as there are far too many, and I'm certain to miss your favorit. However, I think it is really useful to get a taste of it.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Three Kingdoms</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Like all of the works we have talked about in this class, there has been a ferocius apetite for seeing them in new formats.

				The earliest television show to be done based on the Three Kingdoms (that I can find at least), produced in Hong Kong by TVB. IT wa scalled God of the River Lok and focused on the relationship between Zhen Fu and Cao Zhi and was released in 1975.
				<br>
				<br>
				Another show emerged in Hong Kong called "the Legendary Prime Minister - Zhuge Liang" was produced in 1985 and stars Adam Cheng. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qx5hDFm34o&list=RD2Qx5hDFm34o)
				<br>
				<br>
				The same year another TV show called Zhuge Liang appeared on Chinese television.
				<br>
				<br>
				Another importnat television series of the Three Kingdoms was produced by CCTV in 1994 (4:08- , 24:30-)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_r3eWfTMDs&list=PLdAMXqGeRsOkXzuocRkBPhe5RhZ6RotGH
				<br>
				<br>
				There were also shows that mix media in some interesting ways. For example, in one adaptation from 2012 called Three Kingdoms RPG, in which a video game addict travels back in time to the Three Kingdoms.
				<br>
				<br>
				An extremely early movie adaptation of the Three Kindoms was made in 1905 called Dingjun Mountain, which was sadly destroyed in a fire in 1940. This was, in fact, the very first Chinese film ever made and stared a Peking opera star Tan Xinpei.
				<br>
				<br>
				There have also been some very large productions based on the Three Kingdoms, including a John Woo adapatation made in 2008 called Red Cliff, which is focused on the battle a Red Cliff (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPAaFlvKts)
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Journey to the West</h2><aside class='notes'>
				Journey to the West is perhaps the most redone of all four works, and the earliest I know of was done in the 1970s (0:00-3:40)
				Monkey (Saiyuki) was first made in 1978 and was produced in Japan (sometimes it is know as Monkey Magic). There are 52 episodes across two seasons (78-79 and 79-80), so you can get your fill of Monkey TV.
				(0:00-3:40) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPOScXbVJO4&list=PLDdZxIdMVEd-1p8pYo6aPlcLgToIlkuK4
				<br>
				<br>
				There was also a 1986 tv shows made by CCTV. This particular version of the show is well know for its faithful reproduction of many of the events of hte novel, and it covers over 70 of the chapters of the novel. There was a second season made in the late 1990s taht covered the other 25 chapters not covered in the original show. Like the novel, the Monk does not show up until around episode 5 (of a total of 25 episodes)
				(1:45-3:00, 27:32-31):
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KNpyKILHM&list=PLIj4BzSwQ-_sfc7l2xm1wQswAd5jqrrDS
				<br>
				<br>
				There was another tv series produced in 1996 in Hong Kong, which was remade in 2002 as the Monkey King: Quest for the Sutra with 40 episode. It was must more slapstick than some other versions, as we can see in this short clip 
				(7:07-9:10) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnXG4_6SWCg
				<br>
				<br>
				There are no shortage of cartoon versions as well, with the 1992 cartoon, Journey to the West, Legends of the Monkey King. This is perhaps considered the most classic of all the animated versions of the story, and exists in 26 episodes (and a made-for-tv movie). It was a joint production between CCTV and the Cinar production company, which was a Canadian company. It first aired in english in canada in 2000 and then later in the us in 2009/10.
				(0:00-3:15, 12:50-, 17:00-17:55): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WUlbwKnwSk&list=PLHloTpmV7roOIxEivpdNIFcPiKyYUiVgv
				<br>
				<br>
				More loose is Dragonball, whose main character Son Goku is based on Monkey from the novels (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT1Dp69D7q0)
				<br>
				<br>
				There are a whole host of movies taht take one or several incidents from the novel and spin them into actxion movies.
				<br>
				<br>
				The earliest film adaptation of the move was done in 1927, and is a silent movie produce in Shanghai. It was actually thought to be lost, but it was discovered in Norway in 2013. We can watch the preview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xibWJfX511U
				<br>
				<br>
				Princess iron fan, made in 1941 was the very first feature length animated film made in China and adapts a story from the novel. (3:00-5:00, 32:00 -): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loqvh1cGXQA
				<br>
				<br>

				Jeffrey Lao directed a number of film adaptations of the story, which starred Stephen Chow, "A Chinese Odessy" with storylines very loosely based on the original novel in which the main characters are reincarnated as bandits after betryaing Tang Sanzang (we can see the trailer here: https://mubi.com/films/a-chinese-odyssey-part-one-pandoras-box/trailer)
				<br>
				<br>

				I do want to spend a bit of time on the Forbidden Kingdom from 2008, a movie that stars both Jet Li and Jackie Chan. From the IMDB description: South Boston teenager Jason Tripitikas (Jason Tripitikas) is an extremely obsessed fan of martial arts films and he awakens from a dream of a battle between the Monkey King and celestial soldiers in the clouds. He visits a pawn shop in Chinatown to buy Wuxia DVDs and discovers a golden staff. On his way home, Jason is harassed by Lupo (Morgan Benoit) and his hooligans, who attempt to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop (Jackie Chan). Hop tries to fight the thieves with the staff, but is shot and wounded. He tells Jason to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Jason flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop by the hooligans and almost shot too, but he is pulled off the roof by the staff and falls backwards onto the asphalt.
				<br>
				<br>
				When Jason regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in ancient China that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan (Jackie Chan), a supposed "immortal", who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu brings Jason to a teahouse and tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King (Jet Li) and the Jade Warlord (Collin Chou). The Jade Warlord tricked the Monkey King into setting aside his magic staff Rúyì Jng Bàng, (literally meaning "Ideal Golden-bound Cudgel") and transformed him into a stone statue, but the Monkey King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about someone, a "Seeker", who will find the staff and free the Monkey King. Just then, they are attacked by the Jade Warlord's men again but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow (Yifei Liu), a young girl who refers to herself in the third person. She reveals that her family was murdered by the Jade Warlord, against whom she has therefore sworn revenge.

				<section><h2>Story of the Western Wing</h2><aside class='notes'>
				There are many fewer adaptations of the Story of the Western Wing, perhaps given its status as a love story (thoguh we can talk about this if you like). There was a silent film called Romance of the Western Chamber made in 1927, though only five of the original ten reels still survive. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ZeTiQHUzs&list=PL8oo3mkgp4vJWdMk9SXySw0-czAQHe5XU)
				<br>
				<br>
				There was also an adaptation made by TVB, like some of the Three Kingdoms and Journey to the west versions. It was made in 2005 and is called Lost in the CHamber of Love, but in this case there is a lot of inversions: Zhang Sheng and Hong Niang fall in love, and Yingying and the emepror get married.
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Water Margin</h2><aside class='notes'>
				The Water Margin, interestingly enough, has largely been adapted into written media rather than visual media (so there are a huge number of manga) and many of the Water Margin TV shows came out in Japan. Interestingly, the 1973 The Water Margin made by Nipon Television was actually filmed in China.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 1983 running to 1986 There was another adaptation called "outlaws of the Marsh", first broadcast in Shandong. This is perhaps the most well regarded adaptation in China
				<br>
				<br>
				There were many movies made based on the Wtaer Margin in the 70s and 80s, largey i nHong Kong. A first one came out in 1972: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBXe2KLbEzI&t=2245s
