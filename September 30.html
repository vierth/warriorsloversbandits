				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>The Formation of Fiction</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Yu starts with a discussion of the evolution of the Xuanznag characater in comparison with the historical person. Recall that we've discussed these differences extensively in class.
					<br>
					<br>
					Baojuan (precious scrolls)
					<br>
					<br>
					Shanshu rare books
					<br>
					<br>
					Think about the transition from the "personal zeal" that moved the historical Xuanzang to take the journey to a journey ordained by the boddhisatva Guanyin and ordered by the tang emperor.
					<br>
					<br>
					"whereas the historical journey began as a secret, tran sgressive act of a pious zealot, the fictive pilgrimage was foreordained by Buddha, superintended throughout by Guanyin (the most popular Goddess of Mercy in Chinese religions), and enthusiastically commissioned by the Tang emperor.
					<br>
					<br>
					Chapter 9, which describes the ordeals Xuanzang's parents faced (and grand parents), but this was not in many of the early versions of the text.
					<br>
					<br>
					19: "The incidents constitutive of the Xuan Zang Lengend..."
					<br>
					<br>
					The book becomes a mixture of stories about buddhas and bodhisattvas and their reincarations, and morality books.
					<br>
					<br>
					Chapter 9 is interseting because events are referred to throughout the novel.
					<br>
					<br>
					20: "If for millennia historiography ruled as "the supreme narrative model in [premodern] China" to which all other literary genres must owe their subservience and emulation, why does the full-length Xiyouji choose to fashion its human protagonist in a manner that would surely try - as it has, indeed, down to the present day - its literate reader's patience"
					<br>
					<br>
					connection wtiht he emperor is extremely important
					<br>
					<br>
					21: "this momentous enterprise of seeking scriptures could not have been an initiative of merely the piety of a little known individual, let alone the rebellious and even treasonous zeal of that person."
					<br>
					<br>
					22: "The historical pilgrim's dedication to visit the Western region was motivated by the quest for doctrinal clarification ( Fashizhuan : "The Master of the Law . . . thus vowed to tour the region of the West so as to inquire about the perplexities [of his faith], and this commitment would make him risk even death for defying "the laws of the state H Se" ( Xingzhuan fTÌfà).16 In sharp contrast, the fictive priest, when promoted to be the emperor's bond-brother for the willingness to serve as the scripture-seeker, said to his ruler: "Your Majesty, what ability and what virtue does your poor monk possess that he should merit such affection from your Heavenly Grace? I shall not spare myself in this journey, but I shall proceed with all diligence until I reach the Western Heaven. If I did not attain my goal, or the true scriptures, I would not dare return to our land even if I were to die. May I fall int0 eternal perdition in Hell
					<br>
					<br>
					This has practical implications: xuanzang had to travel only at night to avoid being caught. in the novel, there is no such hesitantcy
					<br>
					<br>
					24: "how pitiful how pitiful (read)
					<br>
					<br>
					Note hte confucian overtones here.
					<br>
					<br>
					25: "Cound a faithful replica of this character who began his famed journey as a treasonous subject be expected to amus and entertain in the popular imagination?
					<br>
					<br>
					Yu also discusses the meaning of Monkey in the context of the novel, and the figure of monkey was already associated with the story in the 12th century, but it wans't until the novel that we saw such an importnat character.
					<br>
					<br>
					There may be a connection with Hanumat of the Ramayana epic, thoughth this connection is still debated by scholars.
					<br>
					<br>
					28: WHy does the scripture-seeker require "an animal companion guardian of such complexity and magnitude in personality and character. The simplified and partial explanation surfacing already in the Flowing-Sand River episode (chapter 22) is that the human pilgrim, who must experience in person the ordeal of traversing "all these strange territories" for the scriptures, is in need of his disciples as "his protective companions, guarding his body and life," but this necessity cannot fully account for the peculiar characterization of Xuanzang, his four disciples, and their intricate relationships mapped out in the narrative."
					<br>
					<br>
					Yu links this back to the beginning of the novel and monkey's own spiritual journey. It is all about cultivating hte mind, and monkey's sturggle with doing so (the monkey of the mind refers to restlessness and unsettled thought) and it takes the journey of the novel for this to become settled.
					<br>
					<br>
					32: "Moreover, Monkey's own experience as the Tang Monk's disciple mirrors his master's experience, one constituted by a series of imprisonment and release, harmonious integration and disastrous dissolution..."
					<br>
					<br>
					34: Read Hu Shi quote... and then Lu xun'said
					these were not good readsings... though we owe a lot ot them for their stdy of the textual history of the works.
					<br>
					<br>
					Yu point sout that "The primary discourse of ficiton, in other words,has already been unalterably infected with the languages of monks, Daoists, and Confucian academics.."
					<br>
					<br>
					35: "We should remember that as Xuanzang embarked on his pilgrimage in the novel, his circle was then enlarged to encom- pass four additional disciples: the monkey, a half-human and half-pig comic (actually a Daoist god exiled from Heaven), a reformed cannibal (another Daoist pariah), and a delinquent dragon-horse as the priest's transportation. This sharp contrast again between the full-length novel and known history also marks the third distinctive development in the journey's fictionalization. Whereas history is constituted by the dedicated efforts of a lone human zealot, the fiction represents the com- bined exertion of a community of invented figures that, in turn, may be construed variously in the story - as different aspects of a single personality, as different constitutive elements of a process (an interior journey in quest of moral self-cultivation, spiritual enlightenment, or physical longevity through alchemy), or as different kinds of individu- als in a society."
					<br>
					<br>
					Yu also discusses the narrator as a voice that offers running commentary reminding reader of alegorical interpretations.
					<br>
					<br>
					Three religions as one is a common refrain...
					<br>
					<br>
					42: " Finally, we are prepared to see how religion and literature converge in the making of the journey's fiction, all without a trace of didacticism or proselytism. The fiction of Xiyouji , let it be bluntly stated, is built upon a fundamental irony: the story of what is purely and incontest- ably a Buddhist cleric's ineradicable acts of devotion to his faith is not only changed radically, but its meaning has been also transformed by means of linguistic signs massively appropriated from other religious traditions.62 This act of fiction-making can read as if Islamic concepts and terminologies have been scoured from the Koran to rewrite Mil- ton's Paradise Lost or Dante's Commedia' The wonder is that the Chinese novel has succeded in stitching so seamlessly a fabric of three religions that have been, and remained, in tension (and occasionally, in serious conflicts) with each other down through the historical culture to the present.

					<section><h2>Chapter 53</h2><aside class='notes'>Chapter 53: note the beginnign of the chapter, in which there is a summary of what just happened. Let's read the poem..."Virtuous acts you must perform..."
						<br>
						<br>
						36: "They dine on wind and rest on water to journey west... read poem"
						<br>
					<br>
						Pilgrim said... "there must be someone running a ferry boat..." Note the juxtaposition bewteen the characters here (zhu bajie screaming)
						<br>
					<br>
						37: Description of the woman and reactin: "On the head a woolen wrap..."
						<br>
					<br>
						"Idiot" here is zhu bajie
						<br>
					<br>
						38 top: "When tripitika saw how clear the water was..."
						<br>
					<br>
						go to where they get stomach aches
						<br>
					<br>
						39: "With loud clip-clops several middle aged women..."
						<br>
					<br>
						
						"when tripitika heard this, he paled with fright..."
						<br>
					<br>
						Think about the amusement Sun Wukong and Sha monk both have for the situation.
						<br>
					<br>
						40 :"Oh Po po, said Tripitika with a moan..."
						<br>
					<br>
						Monkey heads off there but they ask for some monetary gifts, but becuase they are monks and don't have any money, they have nothign to giev.
						<br>
					<br>
						42 "You are quite mad! said the doaist
						<br>
					<br>
						42 very bottom "Anger flared in his heart..."
						<br>
					<br>
						44 top, the True Immortal recognizes Sun Wukong as one who tangled with his nephew.
						<br>
					<br>
						44 "Your nephew is ery well off (bottom of first paragraph)
						<br>
					<br>
						Monkey fights him and defeats him but every time he trys to get water from the well he is thwarted.
						<br>
					<br>
						He comes back to get help, and tripitika is concerned about being left alone while sick.
						<br>
					<br>
						46: "You are all women here..."
						<br>
					<br>
						49: "When the great sage heard this..."
						<br>
					<br>
						50 "In less than the time of a meal..." This is a common way to denote a short period of tiem.
						<br>
					<br>
						</aside></section>
						<section><h2>Chapter 54</h2><aside class='notes'>52: "We tell you now about tripitika and his disciples..."
							<br>
							<br>

							<br>
					<br>
							53: "As master and disciples followed through its several turns..."
							<br>
							<br>	
							54: "we tell you now about that cleark..." think about procedurs for travel and the necessary permissions, but also about the phrase "we tlel you now..."
							<br>
					<br>
							The queen proposes taking the pilgrims to ensure the continuation of the kingdom, but
							<br>
					<br>
							55: "Then the clerk of the post-house said..."
							<br>
					<br>
							Tripitika keeps saying that he has "left the family" and he stops talking entirely at the propspect of a marriage.
