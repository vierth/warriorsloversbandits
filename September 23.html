				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>The Journey to the West</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Buddhism in the Tang</h2><aside class='notes'><p>buddhism entered china at some point in the first or second century AD, moving along trade routes between China and india, though the first confirmed documentation of this comes from the 2nd century. Most early buddhists were in central asia but they gradually found their way east until Buddhism became an important local relgion. In some traditions it merged with Daoism to form Zen buddhism (thought this was a later development). It eventually became one of the most important religions in Tang China. In the 5th century monks began taking pilgrimages to India to find religious texts.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Xuan Zang</h2><img src='resources/xuanzang.jpg' style='max-width: 20%;'><p style="font-size: .2em">From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xuanzang_w.jpg</p>
				<aside class='notes'><p>He won't be introduced in the two chapters we read for today, but the Tang Senzang of the Journey to the West is based on a historical figure known as the monk xuanzang</p>
				<p>Xuan Zang lived from 602 to 664. He was from somewhere in Henan. He became a monk at a young age and traveled around China looking for buddhist writings, owing to the fall of the Sui dynasty he moved around quite a bit</p>
				<p>Once the Tang dynasty was established he eventually found his way to the capital city.</p>
				<p>Like a few other monks of the time, Xuanzang was concerned that the religious texts that had reached China from India were corroputed.</p>
				<p>He began to learn sanskrit and hoped to track down originals of the important sutras.</p>
				<p>The story goes that he had a drive that convinced him that he needed to travel to India, a journey which woudl eventually take 16 years.</p>
				<p>When he left China, there was actually a prohibition on leaving because of an ongoing war at the borders. Regardless, Xuanzang was able to slip out of the country and make his journey</p>
				<p>Interestingly, today there are memorials at various stops he made across Central Asia and India.</p>
				<p>While in India, xuan zang acquired over 600 buddhist texts written in sanskrit. he brought these back to Chinaa, and when he returned to the capital in Chang'an he set up a translation bureau with the blessing of the emperor.</p>
				<p>interestingly, this action has preserved some buddhist texts that woudl not otherwise exist, as the sanskrit originals have been lost. he is credited with translating an insane number of volumes (over 1000)</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Great Tang Records of The Western Regions</h2>
				<h2>大唐西域記</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>The journey to the west is VERY loosely based on the account of Xuan zang's journey that is found in this historical record. This work was written by Xuan Zang at the behest of the Emperor. It contains extensive descriptions of the places he wentand the sights he saw.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Wu Cheng'en</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Wu cheng'en was the author of the journey to the west and he lived from around 1500 to 1580 (though the exact dates of his life remain unkonwn)</p>
				<p>He was from Jiangsu and hoped to become an official in the Imperial government but was never able to pass the exams, which were necessary to enter officialdom. He was poor and did not have children, but was renouned as a poet</p>
				<p>He wrote journey to the west anonymously, as writing this sort of book was not the sort of thing that was looked upon well at the time.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Journey to the West</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>The book was first published in the 1590s and, as just mentioned, was published anonymously. This was before the novel was recognized as an important artform that was worthy of scholars attention.</p>
				<p>There are a number of translations of the novel, the most famous one is probably "Monkey" which was done by Arthur Whaley. Though it is important to note that this was not a full translatino of the novel.</p>
				<p>The novel is episodic in form and can be divided into several different parts. There is an introductory section where we meet Sun Wukong, or monkey, then a section where we meet Sanzang, the bulk of the adventure describes getting to india and procuring the sutras, and then it ends with a return to China</p>
				<p>It should be noted that this novel is not like the Three kingdoms in taht it is a fairly sober reflection of historical events (as it might have been being based on a historical book). Instead it is a fantastical journey into some wacky lands.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Tang Senzang</h2>
				<h2>Sun Wukong</h2>
				<h2>Zhu Bajie</h2>
				<h2>Sha Wujing</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>Although the "main character" of the novel is this figure Tang Senzang, he really isn't the star of the show.</p>
				<p>Sun Wukong really is the most important protaganist and he is the central figure in the chapter that we read for today. He is a monkey who gains supernatural powers and is eventually tasked with protecting Tang Senzang on his journey to india.</p>
				<p>All of the secondary characters experience some sort of fall, and Zhu Bajie is no different than Sun Wukong, in that his fall from grace was getting too drunk at a party for the gods. Sha Wujing also broke a glass belonging to an important diety and transformed into a monster.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 1</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Here we are jsut introduced to the monkey king, who is from Flower Furit mountan and was born from an immortal stone. he leaves the omuntain to seek enlightenment. He seeks daoist cultivation.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 2</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>83: "Now we were speaking of the handsome..." Be sure to continue to "He spoke with words so florid</p>
				<p>There is a very interesting represntation fo daoism in this book, and one that is fairly different than what we see in ancient philosophical texts. 84: "The patriarch said...</p>
				<p>The patriarch offers to teach several lessons. Note the parallelism the exists here. how would it be...</p>
				<p>The monkey king refuses all of these things and eventually 86: the patriarch gets upset.</p>
				<p>He goes to see the patriarch and is taught</p>
				<p>88: At that moment the very origin was revealed to Wukong</p>
				<p>88: Three years went by swiftly...</p>
				<p>90: The cloud summoersault. One day when the patriarch and the various pupils...</p>
				<p>91 bottom: One day early in summer</p>

				<p>93: Monkey discovers his people are being bullied and we get our first story of martial prowesss.</p>
				<p>95 bottom, halfway thorugh second to last paragraph:"Stop cried Wukong..." Note the repetition here</p>
				<p>96: Bottom fight scene!</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 4</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>118: Description of heaven, read together. How does this compare with 3Guo?</p>

				<p>121: Horse poem</p>

				<p>125 Let's look at the challenge here! "You lawless ape..."</p>
