				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Final Presentations</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Your final presentations will need to be recorded. As mentioned at the beginning of class, this can be a very simple powerpoint with a voice over or it can be a full fledge animation or movie. I'll go over, very quickly, how to make a recording like this on a Mac and mention how to do it on a Windows machine. If you don't have a computer you can use, there are computers at the library you can use for this.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you do a powerpoint, your presentation should have a minimum of four slides: A title slide with the title of your project, two slides that illustrate the points you hope to make, and a closing slide.
				<br>
				<br>
				On a mac making a screen recording is quite easy.

				<section><h2>Career Session</h2><p>Tuesday the 19th</p><p>5:00 pm</p>
				<aside class='notes'>For those of you who are Chinsee Studies majors, we are having a presentation by the career center (and we will feed you some food from Peter Chang's, so if you are a major I really encourage you to come)!</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Martin Huang</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>This article focuses on the nature of authorship in late imperial Chinese fiction (or xiaoshuo, as huang is clear to keep distinct). But he opens his article with a focus on the practice of offering commentary (or xiaoshuo pingdian, the act of adding commentary and punctuations that aid readers in interpretation). When reading these works in the 17th century it was only natural that these were a central focus of reading practice, but many modern typeset editiosn completely dump them, which deprives us of much of the context making apparatus that contemporary readers enjoyed.
						<br>
						<br>
				Another key issue Huang notes in trying to assess what authorship means in the Chinese xiaoshuo context is the complicated textual history of every book. What hapens when the book we have recieved has undergone signficant transformation from the days before the xiaoshuo itself was written (in terms of its source materias) through to later days when commentators edited the texts to better fit with their own ideas?
				<br>
				<br>
				Huang hopes to reframe this discussino of authroship in light of the commentaries. He does place this in light of western theoretical discussions by discusing Barthes and Foucault, who both wrote very critical essays on authorship (Barthes wrote The Death of the Author, and Foucault wrote What is an Author). For Foucault "THe author-function is therefore characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society." It is something that only really becomes important when someone might need to be punished for what they wrote.
				<br>
				<br>
				Huang links "authorship" to "authority" and connects this with very early ideas of about authorship found in confucian writting. Who has the authority to write a text, and in the earliest days it was the Shengren (sage). Confucius very famously said 述而不作. I transmit, I don't author.
				<br>
				<br>
				Jin Shengtan, the author of the most important commentary on the Water margin etners into the conversation with precisely this idea: only the sages have the authority needed to author things, but this has not stopped many others from doing so. The result is a lot of very bad writings that should never have been written. it is also the reason why he imself cannot write but must stick to commenting on things.
				<br>
				<br>
				The practical result of all of this is the notion of authorship in Chinese literature is not an easy one, and it is even more confused when we look at novels and their commentaries,  in which "This blurring of the distinctinos between an author and a commentator was much much more common and signficant in the productino and consumption of traditional xiaoshuo commentaries" "'author' was often a figure carefully manipulated by the commentator to enhance the authority of his own interprtation of the work. Here, the author's control of the meaning of a text was seriously challenged."
				<br>
				<br>
				Antholgoizing became very important aspect of late ming literary production, and an interesting move that some of these compilers made was that it was valid to offer an interpretation of a piece of literature that might differ from the original author's intent. This was necessary in some cases because works were created so far into the past that we can't actulaly recover intent in any meaningful way.
				<br>
				<br>
				When we start thinking about novels, things become even more complicated, because of the absense of a fixed author (and as huang states "writeres were more inclined to consider themselves 'compilers' or 'editors' rather than real 'authros'") which in terun gave more space for commentators to influence the text.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Water Margin offers a very interesting example of this, given the different versions of the text that exist (long versions ranging from 100 to 120 chapters) and short version around 70 chapters (Jin shengtan also added a preface to the novel which he attributed to Shi Nai'an, but which he wrote insmelf)
				<br>
				<br>
				53: "One thing shared by Zhu Xi and Jin Shengtan..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Importantly, these commented editions of xiaoshuo tended to become the definitive versions (the mao version of the sanguo, jin's water margin, and zhang zhupo's jinpingmei).
				<br>
				<br>
				There is also an interesting promotion of the reader over the "author" that we see in these commentaries, noting the act of adding these commentaries creates a new text.
				<br>
				<br>
				On page 61 Huang notes Zhang Zhupo's attitude: "if you read the Chin Ping Mei as a work of literature..."
				<br>
				<br>
				we should hesitate to understand this as a readers response, as huang points out, because this more about policing the meaning of the text that saying that any reader's interpretation is equally valid.
				<br>
				<br>
				Actual vs implied author is importnat. The historical author is not really that meaningful but the author as implied through a careful reading of the text is what matters.

				<section><h2>Chapter 23</h2><aside class='notes'>
				As with most of the chapters in this book, we are dropped into the middle of the action, and here we meet Wu Song who has been lviing with Lord Chai for about a year. Song Jiang has been helped to escape from his predicament and is introdeced to Song Jiang.
				<br>
				<br>				
				Song says that's he heard of Wu but had not expected to meet him here.
				<br>
				<br>
				There is an interesting presentatino of male friendship in this novel, and we see evidince of it here (222): "Song Jiang, very pleased, walked hand in hand" What do you make of this?
				<br>
				<br>
				222: "in the lamplight Song Jiang noted with pleasure what a fine figure of a man Wu Song was..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Lord Chai had been cooling to Wu Song because of his bad temper... (223) "Why incidentally had Chai Jin.."
				<br>
				<br>
				Wu Song decides he needs to travel home to see his brother (223) "The two were constantly in each other's company"
				<br>
				<br>
				A scene of sending off in which Song Jiang walks with Wu for a number of miles before allowing him to go.
				<br>
				<br>
				WU Song swears himself as Song Jiang's blood brother before they part.
				<br>
				<br>
				Here we get to one of the most famous incidents in the Water Margin (224) with a common storytellers convention within the novel: "We'll divide our story in two and now talk of Wu Song"
				<br>
				<br>
				(224): "He travelled for several days and came to Yanggu County"
				<br>
				<br>
				225: "Very good wine!"
				<br>
				<br>
				226: "The host continued to stall"
				<br>
				<br>
				226: "The tavern keeper ran after him..."
				Here we get a story of the local area in which the man is warning him. We'll see further proof as Wu moves along.
				<br>
				<br>
				227: "He proceeded up the slope, holding his staff level"
				<br>
				<br>
				227: "There isn't any tiger"
				<br>
				<br>
				How is tension built here?
				<br>
				<br>
				228: "He collected his broad--brimmed felt hat from beside the rock"
				<br>
				<br>
				228: Don't you know?
				<br>
				<br>
				The rest of the chapter is focused on the reward he gets for defeating the tiger. 229 "The hunters presented him with game and drank to his health."
				<br>
				<br>
				He meets the local magistrate (230) "When the townpeople heard that a brave young fellow..."
				What do you make of the distributing of this reward" What does this tell about Wu.
				<br>
				<br>
				He is promoted 231: "If Wu Song had not met that man would bloody corpses..."
			</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 25</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>The interim chapter is largely about Wu Song discovering that his brother has moved to Yanggu county from Qinghe with his wife (who had been married to him because the family she had been with previously didn't like her). Wu's elder brother was ugly and mocked for his appearance and she was very displeased with him. As such, when Wu Song appears she tries to strike up an affair with him, and Wu spurns here. She gets very angry at him and tries to drive a wedge between the Wu Brothers. Wu Song is shortly therafter deputized to go to the Eastern Capital with some money from his sponsors. In the meantime through the gobetween of a neighboor, Pan Jinlian starts up an affair with Ximen Qing.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the beginning of Chapter 25 a young boy has been berated by MIstress Wang, the woman who set up the affair between Ximen and Pan. Angered, he decides he is going to track down the elder WU brother and bring him home to break up the affair.
				<br>
				<br>
				255: "The aggrieved boy, basket in hadn, went in search of Wu the Elder" There is subtext here that is being interpreted by the characters.
				<br>
				<br>
				256: "Today I went looking for Ximen Qing with a basket of snowy pears"
				<br>
				<br>
				They hatch a plan to catch them in the act, because Wu could not hope to face off with Ximen qing.
				<br>
				<br>
				256: "That old bitch pummeled me..."
				<br>
				<br>
				257: "Hit me, will you!"
				<br>
				<br>
				258: "The next day Ximen inquired"
				<br>
				<br>
				They decide to do him in.
				259: "The wretch is very ill. Take advantage..."
				<br>
				<br>
				260: "Golden Lotus took the packet of medicinal powders..."
				<br>
				<br>
				261: "there's only one more difficulty,"
