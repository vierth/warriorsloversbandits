					<p>September 18th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>The Novel to Chapter 119</h2><aside class='notes'><p>We've now seen the deaths of some of the most important characters in the novel, and we should be thinking about what thsi means for the percieved legitimacy of each of the kingdoms</p>
				<p>Without Liu Bei, is Shu legitimate? What do you think the Maos thought (or do you recall what the Maos thought?)</p>
				<p>Now that Cao Cao doesn't control Wei, are the less vilanous, more, or about the same?</p>
				<p>After Liu Bei dies, Shu has to deal with some rebel uprisings in addition to the threates from Wu and Wei. Zhuge Liang sets up an alliance with Wu and repels an invasion by Cao Pi</p>
				<p>The fight against the Man tribe, this is an interesting sub story in which they fight in the southern Jungles in what would now be southern China in Yunnan and in the jungles of northern burma</p>
				<p>Zhuge captures and releases the rebel leader multiple times and beings to win over the Man people and eventual subdues them.</p>
				<p>Cao Pi dies and Cao Rui takes over, in the meantime Zhuge Liang engineers a rift between Sima Yi, one of Cao's best advisors and Cao. When this happens, it is time to invade. They come close to defeating Wei but doesn't quite do it.</p>
				<p>Jiang Wei, a Wei general prevents the capture of a third city and stalls the Shu attack. Jiang defeats Zhao Zilong, but defects to Shu after meeting Zhuge Liang.</p>
				<p>Another rebellion happens and Zhuge's army is attacked from behind. They fend it off</p>
				<p>Sima yi exposes someone who is going to defect saving Wei. Things turn against the Shu a bit here, when Zhuge Liang trusts generals who end up failing</p>
				<p>Zhao Zilong dies of natural causes, and this leads to the gradual decline of the Shu armies.</p>
				<p>Zhuge has back and forth victories and is about to press his advantage when Wei spies make the emperor think Zhuge is goign to depose him, so he can't take advantage.</p>
				<p>Zhuge fvandes multiple times but is getting old. He starts a ritual that will allow him to continue to live for 12 more years, but is interupted. Jiang Wei receives Zhuge's teachings and Zhuge passes away.</p>
				<p>Cao Rui, no longer harried by Zhuge, becomes a despot</p>
				<p>Sima Yi puts down rebellions, but is mistreated by the Cao family. Eventually he plots a coup and takes over (though he does not depose the young Cao Fang on the throne.</p>
				<p>Jiang Wei invades but is defeated</p>
				<p>Sima Yi dies of old age as does Sun Quan. While Wu is mourning Sun Quan, Sima Shi (sima yi's son) invades). They fail and Wu invades back but fails miserablly.</p>
				<p>Jiang Wei tries to invade again and fails, Cao Fang tries to plot against Sima Shi but the plot is uncovered, and Cao Fang is replaced by Cao Mao.</p>
				<p>Sima Shi dies of cancer, and his brother Sima Zhao takes over. Sima Shi's general Deng Ai hands a major defeat to Wu</p>
				<p>Wu meanwhile is realing from internal strife in which members of the Sun clan depose and kill each other.</p>
				<p>Jiang Wei continues to fight Wei but rumors swirl and he is recalled</p>
				<p>Euncuchs rise in Shu and wreak havoc (note the circularity of the novel).</p>
				<p>Taking advantage of the Eunch Huang Hao, Sima Zhao invades as the eunuch keeps information away from the empeoror.</p>
				<p>The Shu emperor surrenders ending the Liu line. Jiang Wei meanwhile refuses to surrender and begins to plot in private and Deng Ai is arrested.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 119</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Jiang attempts to keep the han line alive and councils the Shu emperor to put up with humiliation for a while: 645: "They two became absorbed in the plans for their grand scheme...Here is death for those who oppose"</p>
				<p>Jiang plots with afriend, while Sima Zhao approaches rapidly.</p>
				<p>646 "Tomorrow is the fest of lanterns..."</p>
				<p>People didn't like this talk of rebellion and  began to plot against Jiang and Zhong</p>
				<p>647 "Now Zhong Hui dreamed a dream...</p>
				<p>647-48 "He bade Jiang..."</p>
				<p>Liu Ch'an is captured 650: "Soon after Liu Ch'an reached the capital..."</p>
				<p>651: "The courtiers thought that so grand an explot..."</p>
				<p>654: "Sima Yan now stood..."</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 120</h2><aside class='notes'><p>The final chapte rof the book wraps things up. Wu is lead by a corrupt and incompetent emperor who is cruel and mismanages</p>
				<p>Eventually Wei decides to invade 663: "Formerly Yang Hu explaine dhis plans..."</p>
				<p>Final poem 669: "The tale is told..."</p></aside></section>
