				Eventually Monkey chuckles to himself and the Sha monk asks him what is going on, so he explains 165: "Zhu bajie is truely idiotic"
				<br>
				<br>

			<section><h2>Taking Historical Fiction Seriously</h2>
			<aside class='notes'>We've talked a lot in this class about how history can end up in fictional works, with both the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and to a lesser extent, with the Journey to the West (focusing largely on how Journey may have rubbed some contemporaries the wrong way. But what if we step back for a moment and think about how these novels can act as an instructive medium, as serious vehichles for historical information in and of themselves.
			<br>
			<br>
			Wills argues that "Mainstream academic historians should take historical novels seriously, as extremely influential and effective transmitters of historical understanding to large audiences and as manifestations of a narrative consiousness that is and ought to be an important element in the work of many writers of nonfiction history."
			<br>
			<br>
			Wills points out that he first picked this idea up when reading robert Van Guliks translates of the Judge Dee mystery stories. These were novels based on court cases in which a maginstrate, one judge dee was in charge of solving a mystory.
			<br>
			<br>
			In these, Wills saw an expression of life in China in the 15th/16th centuries that was valuable for historical understanding that "includ[es] some vivid portraits of beggars, peddlers, and others whose lives we know in an abstract way from the histrocial recor, characters who frequently appear in Chinese fiction, but who hardly ever can be portrayed as individuals in nonfiction history."
			<br>
			<br>
			This is not just useful for cultural historians, they are also an importnat source for the general populace taht is not able to travel widely to see monuments and histories (note that this article was written in the 1980s and things ahve changed quite a bit).
			<br>
			<br>
			Wills discusses the novel Shogun by James Clavell as a cite of historical discourse, even though, as wills puts it, there were some errors deeply embeddedin the structure of the novel. Regardless, it shows the psychology of another place/age.
			<br>
			<br>
			Wills also brings in televisijon serios of Shogun as a broader popularization of the narratives within the novel.
			<br>
			<br>
			Wills also mentiosn Robert Elegants Manchu, which introduces readers to a fictionalization of the Ming-Qing transition. He offers much less praise of this novel: "the dialogue is wooden, none of the characters is psychologically credible, and the imparting of information is not sustained by the reader's participation in the anlien protagonists progress toward understanding; the height of his appreciation of Chinese culture seems to be the perception that Chinese politics are unfathomably complex and subtle... But the novel made me think. Had I written it, I would not have given the Deng-zhou rembeillion 0f 1632 the importance that Elegant does in his narrative of the civil wars, but reading his made me want to go back and look again."
			<br>
			<br>
			So this becomes useful as a counternarrative that forces better understandign of the period. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This is not a phenomenon limited to novels about Asia, as he points to Ivanhoe as an example of romanticizing the English Middle ages. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Roots is another exmaple of this. Has anyone seen roots? We watched it when I was in highschool, but it came out in the early 1980s.
			<br>
			<br>
			This essay touches on some of the interesting moral issues historians face: "Those who read nonficiton history with fascination and even try to write it will find one important element in their attraction to history completely missing from the histroical novel: the pathos of teh search for what actually happened. For many of us, the shock of reality, the astonishment that we can know as much as we do about past events is a deeply human part of the appeal fo history." That this is missing from historical novels is perhaps the central difference, this lack of a moral centering of what actually happened. I'm not sure I myself buy this so much, but it is an interesting idea.
			<br>
			<br>
			Still, as wills points out, the novel provides a glimpse of the general feel of certain eras in a way that histories cannot provide. So it becomes "what itmust have been like"
			<br>
			<br>
			Wills points out that "The strengths of historical novels in comparison to other mass media are formidable". They can contain lots of information that can be read slowly and absorbed. And this for people who would not otherwise read a history ("especially one with footnotes")
			<br>
			<br>
			"Henry Smith pointed out in his introduction to Learning from Shogun that many Japan schoalrs would respond to his titlte in the same way many architects responded to a book entitlted Learning from Lass fagos. In both cases, he suggested, a serious confrontatin with a phenomenon of vast popular appeal could help professionals sort out their basic priorities. If we can't learn to take histroical novels seriously, we ingore some of the most potent shapers of the general historical consciousness and we impoverish our own efforts to understand and explain the past"
			<br>
			<br>
			What are yoru thoughts on this?

			<section><h2>Chapter 99</h2>
			<aside class='notes'>
			T has found the scriptures and his quest is ocmplete. the last two chatpers of the novel focus on wrapping up the adventure. This chapter focuses on the results in heaven. As this was a karmic adventure that was centered on all of our heros paying back mistakes in teh past, now we can see how they measure up in the eyes of heaven.
			<br>
			<br>
			398: "they showed genuine devotion and determination.."
			<br>
			<br>
			This is followed by a breakdown of all of the things that happened to T in the novel. What do you make of this? Why do you think this is here? The chapter numbers were added  by Anothony Yu, by the way. Note that this is framed a sa list of ordeals. Why?
			<br>
			<br>
			402: The journey: one hundred and eight thousand miles... What do you make of this "being on file"?
			<br>
			<br>
			9 x 9 is the perfect number here, but T has only gone through 80. so they must artificiatially create one more. T must do one last one for immortality.
			<br>
			<br>
			So they force the Eight Vajra guardians, who were escorting them back to Tang China to drop them back to ground. 
			<br>
			<br>
			They find themselves in a place that had trod many years ago in the adventure and they have to cross a river. 403: "Stop grumbling, Second elder brother..."
			<br>
			<br>
			A turtle they knew from before carries all of them across the river, a process that takes more than half a day. But T had promised to ask Thaghata about the turtles fortunes but he had forggoten, so the turtle takes a dive. here T is shown to have attaine dth way, and he doesn't sink. Monkey gets them all across.
			<br>
			<br>
			They climb up on the riverbank and 405: "suddenly a violate gale arose;..."
			<br>
			<br>
			Demons try to snatch away the scriptures, as they have incurred the jealous of heaven and earth. they defend the scriptutres and open them to dry in the sun
			<br>
			<br>
			A local village leader finds them there and asks why they have not visited.
			<br>
			<br>
			408:N "After tripitika had thus given a thorough..."
			<br>
			<br>
			What do you make of this?
			<br>
			<br>
			Monkey says that 408 :the sustra may have been perfiect...
			<br>
			<br>
			The villagers offer tea, but T has already become immortal and has no interest in the food. Even Zhu baijie is not interested.
			<br>
			<br>
			410: statues "After he had looked a the monestary..."
			Thoughts on teh statues?
			<br>
			<br>
			They escape in the dark of night, as it seems like the villagers won't let them go, and the vajra guardiens scoop them up again as they leave.
			</aside></section>
			<section><h2>Chapter 100</h2>
			<aside class='notes'>
			The locals who they left behind were upset that thye had left, but they start a new tradition of brining gifrts and burning sacrifices at the statues.
			<br>
			<br>
			The pilgirms, meanwhile, are delivered to Chang an.
			<br>
			<br>
			A tower had already been prepared to recieve the scripture, which he was visitning when the pilgrims arrived.
			<br>
			<br>
			Only T can go down, as the rest remain in heaven, suggest the Vajra guardians, but the pilgrims refues and they all go down. 
			<br>
			<br>
			414: "the entire entourage thus entered together the city of Chang an"
			<br>
			<br>
			414: "One of the former disciples of Tripitka said..."
			<br>
			<br>
			415: Summary of getting the scritures "When your subject..."
			<br>
			<br>
			The length of the journey is revealed in both distance and time. what do you think about how this is measured via the rescript? 417: "It was handed over..."
			<br>
			<br>
			417: Poem on a feast. what do you think of this? and its differences from the heavenly feasts we saw earlier in the noveL?
			<br>
			<br>
			There are many other celebrations, and poems recording the events described in the novels. As they are depositing the scriptures in the tower the emeror built, the Vajra Guardiens instruct them to return with them to Spirit mountain.
			<br>
			<br>
			Here we see the Buddha bestow titles upon them (in parallel with the Tang emperor, what do you think of this parallelism)
			<br>
			<br>
			Zhu bajie is less than pleased with his appoitnment 425: "FOr the merit of toting the luggage"	
			<br>
			<br>
			427: "We have a testimonal poem for them..."
			<br>
			<br>
			I submitt...
			<br>
			<br>
			429: "Such are these various buddhas in all the worlds..."
