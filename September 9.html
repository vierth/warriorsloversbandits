				<section><h2>How to Read the Sanguo</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Today I had you read David Roy's essay on how to read the Sanguo, focused on Mao Zonggang's approach. The reason i did this is because it is importhat to understand how contemporary readers would have appraoched the San Guo, and one of the best ways of getting access to this is looking at what commentators had to say about it. Now if you recall, I mentioned previously that Mao and his father were responsible fro the most commonly read version of the novel, chaning poems, shortening the text, and so forth. But their readning of the novel had significant influence on its reception.</p>
				<p>Mao Lun, the father has an interesting attitude towards creating the commentary, saying that he put it off until he went blind. What do you think is the significance of this? For me it is meant to convey that the creation of the commentary should not be viewed as a serious endeavor (and Mao Lun says as much directly). His commentary to the pipa ji was dictated to his son, Mao Zonggang</p><p>Mao Lun claimed that the Pipa ji was critical of a Wang Si, and contemporary commentators felt that this rethorical strategy was dumb. Of course it wasn't, there is literally no evidence that this is the case.</p><p>David Roy points out that the commentary to the Three Kingdoms was written in partial reaction to Jin Shengtan's essays on the Water Margin, which we will be reading later in the semester. But it is key to note that Mao argues the Three Kingdoms reaffirms conventional authority (the Water Margin subverts it). They emphasize the "moral rightness" of the text. Mao Zonggang definitely corresponded with Jin Shengtan, they both lived in the same city at the same time, but the Maos seem a little cheeky in how they regard Jin.</p><p>Both the Maos and Jin are happy to edit these extremely famous works they are writing about. Why do you think that is? Do you think it is a bit presumptuous to be editing it? We can do better? Note that the Maos claim they found an older edition and they are merely using the one that hews closest to the origijnal. This is a rhetorical strategy that is very common in this type of work. READ PAGE 148, "two years ago..."</p>
			<p>earliest edition of the Commentary dates to 1679 but claims are made taht it was written in the 1640s. some scholars lke Lu Xun actually attributed it to Jin Shengtan</p>
			<p>Practice of adding a "fanli" or editorial principles was a common one and explain the process they used for editing (which largely amounts to restoring some old version of the novel, but most likely they were using the 1522 popular edition that Li Zhi had written a preface to</p>

			<section><h2>The Action So Far</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Let's try to get a sense of what is going on at this point in the novel, rather than try to follow every minute detail of the action. We've seen many many people die, but right now let's lay out the alliances. By Chapter 40, Liu Bei (Xuan De) is together with his sworn brothers, and they have just recently recruited Kong'ming (or Zhuge Liang) to act as their military strategist. Meanwhile, Cao Cao has fully gained control of his territory, and Liu Biao, the person Liu Bei was working for in Chapter 34 from last time dies. His wife's family takes over and Liu Bei flees. The flight is succesful because Zhuge Liang lays a bunch of traps for Cao Cao.</p>
			<p>Liu Bei's sense of honor prevents him from abandoning anyone, so he tries to protect all the civilians in the area, which leads to Cao Cao being able to defeat him. In the tulmut, one of Liu Bei's wives is injured and when Zhao Zilong refuses to leave her behind, she kills herself to give them a chance to escape. So let's think about the realtionship between filial piety, that is what do you owe your leige lord and your family, and how does this often cause problems?</p>
			<p>Liu Bei decides he has to ally with Sun Quan and Wu Guo becuase otherwise Cao Cao will definitely take over. Lu Su, an envoy from Wu comes to negotiate a truce between them. Zhuge Liang goes with Lu Su to arrange this.</p>
			<p>Zhuge Liang insists that the alliance must fight Cao Cao, and Sun Quan decided to go with whatever Zhou Yu decides to do. They both advocate for peace (in a strange switch of events) and Zhuge Liang suggests sending Cao Cao several women. One of these women is Zhou Yu's wife, and this causes Zhou Yu to declare war, just as Zhuge had hoped</p>
			<p>Zhou Yu is in charge of the military campaign and they win a quick battle against Cao Cao. Zhou Yu knows that Zhuge is going to be a problem, so constantly plots to have him killed. He also plots to kill Liu Bei but abandons the plan for fear of Guan Yu. This takes up to Chapter 46</p></aside></section>
			<section><h2>The Battle of Red Cliffs</h2>
			<aside class='notes'>The main focus of the chapters we read for today is the Battle of Chi Bi or the battle of the red clifs, which is one of the most famous battles in the novel and in all of Chinese history. There is very little clear evidence of where this battle actually took place. It most likely took place somewhere along the Yangzi river but its been a matter of debate since the 300s exatly where this happened.</aside></section>
			<section><img src="resources/chibihunan.png"><aside class='notes'>There are inscriptions in the side of the cliff at Chibi city in Hubei that suggest this is where the battle occured, dating from at least the Song dynasty. Note that this city was renamed to Red Cliff City in 1998 to link the location more tightly to the historical battle.</aside></section>

			<section><h2>Su Shi's Red Cliffs</h2><aside class='notes'>There is ahill in Hangzhou called Chibi (though actually it is red nose, not red cliffs) where Su Shi, the extremly famous song dynasty poet claimed the battle took place.</aside></section>

			<section><a href="https://patricksiu.org/first-ode-on-the-red-cliffs-qian-chibifu-%E5%89%8D%E8%B5%A4%E5%A3%81%E8%B3%A6-2/">The First ode on the Red Cliffs</a></section>
			<section><h2>Chapter 46</h2><aside class='notes'>
				<p>Preperations are being made for a giant battle between the Wu and Liu Bei's armies and Cao Cao, because they know if CC continues to dominate that he will unify the country under his own rule, and they can't have that. So the armies are gathered at Red Clifs and a naval engagment is oging to comence soon. Cao Cao outnumbers of the Wu and Liu alliance and without some extreme strategery, they are doomed. A lot of pressure, as you might imagine is building up on Zhou Yu the field commander.</p>
				<p>At this point in the novel, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang are working closely together but it is a fraught relationship. As I entioned a moment ago, Zhou Yu knows that Zhuge is dangerous, he is far too smart. Zhou Yu has just come off of a successful frame job where Cao Cao killed some of his strategists. But Zhou Yu thinks Zhuge saw through the ruse, so send Lu Su to see if he did. Chapter 46 opens with Lu Su going to Zhuge, who informs him that he did indeed know.</p>
				<p>READ 522 Lu Su was quite dumbfounded... Do not ask too much you will see presently</p>
				<p>Zhou Yu asks Zhuge liang what weapons are best, and Zhuge says "arrows."</p>
				<p>READ 523 READ Your opinion and mine agree..." What do you make of this bravado?</p>
				<p>Zhou Yu thinks he has tricked Zhuge and says as much. What do you thnk of this fighting when they have a much larger enemy right at the gates? How is this similar to the other episodes we've seen?</p>
				<p>The plan: READ 524: I look to you for the loan of a score of vessels</p>
				<p>It was a foggy night and they went down the river, and there is a very long poem that discusses it</p>
				<p>They sailed to near the enemy lines they began to beat drums and shout to attrack the attention of Cao Cao's troops. Because of the fog, they didn't dare to venture out and instead just shot hundreds and thousands of arrows out. But becuase Zhuge had set the boats up to get hit by the arrows, it was not a problem at all</p>
				<p>READ 527 "We thank you Sir Minister for the arrows.</p>
				<p>READ 527: YOu are really superhuman...</p>
				<p>All of this makes Zhou Yu grumpy, but they the decide it is time to plan for the matter at hand. They decide to write their ideas for plans on the plams of their hands and then show each other, and they both arrive at the conclusion that they should use fire.</p>
				<p>Cao Cao sends out some folks to pretend to go over to Zhou Yu's side, but they are to act as spies. Zhou Yu immediately sees through this because they didn't rbring their families with them, but he pretended to not understand.</p>
				<p>Zhou Yu needs to send a counter spy over, and Huang Gai, who is a loayl minister to Wu agrees to it. So they decide to punish him needlessly and make it look like Zhou Yu treats him horrible. He is threatened with death and eventually only beaten, but so it looks like he woudl have a reason to desert.</p>
				<p>531: Zhuge isn't decieved "Lu Su went to see the suffering officer" and uses this to trick Zhou Yu into thinking he has been decieved</p>
			</aside></section>
			<section><h2>Chapter 49</h2><aside class='notes'><p>For the plan to work, if they really want to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet, they need to be sure that there is wind when the battle starts, otherwise it is going to be hopeless.</p><p>Zhou Yu has fallen sick and seeems like he is on deaths door, but it is because of stress in preperation for the battle, becuase he knows that he has to depend on the weather.</p>
			<p>Discussion of medical treatment 552-553</p>
			<p>553: I have no great talent... What do you make of the use of magic here?</p>
			<p>554: K'ung Ming took his leave...</p>
			<p>Dramatic tension: it takes until the last possible sectiod to work, even though everythig is poised for battle. Cao Cao's spies are kept far form teh plans.</p>
			<p>555 bottom "Toward the third watch..."</p>
			<p>Zhou Yu sends off some folks to kill Kongming, but of course he knows that this is going to happen, so bails before they get there</p><p>The attach begins! Someone is sent to cut lines of communcation and then they set fire to Cao Cao's fleet.
			</p>
			<p>Zhuge Liang returns to Liu Bei' group and directs them, but I want to focus on what happens with Guan Yu READ 559 "All this time Guan Yu has been silently..."</p>
