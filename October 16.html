					<p>October 16th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Story of the Western Wing</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Today we are shifting gears pretty significantly. We are going to be moving from looking at stories that have explicit connectiosn with historical events to a more fictional work. We are discussing it here because of its tight connectiosn with how people understand their past (if you remember last time someone mentioned that this story tends to be more appealing to women in China now (though it was universially loved in imperial China
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Yuan Zhen and the Story of Ying Ying</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Yuan Zhen lived from 779 to 831. He was most famous as a poet, but he also held a number of important positions in the imeprial governement. he was decended from rulers form the Northern Wei, meaning he, like many people in Tang China, was not of Han descent. he was ppointed to an important position in 822 but like others we've discussed lsot it due to court intrigue. He was also quite famous as a friend of Bai Juyi, whose poetry we will be reading later in class.	
						<br>
						<br>
						The story itself focuses on a Zhang sheng who rescues a family from troubles brought on by rebellions...						<br>
						<br>
						<br>

				<section><h2>The Yuan Dynasty</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>1279-1368 was one of the shortest dynasties and it was established by Kublai Khan.</aside></section>
				
				<section><h2>Drama <i>zaju</i> 雜劇</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>We've been talkign about novels so far in this class, but today we are going to be discussing our first play. This was a genre that first emerged in the Song dynasty, but did not really take off as a significant genre until the Yuan dynasty.
				<br>
				<br>
				These dramas are generally four act plays, and almost always have a happy ending (usually in the form of a reunion at the end.
				<br>
				<br>
				Zaju is a mixed mode form in that it brought together prose dialogure with poetry and signing mixed in (when we see the names of songs these were the equivelant of musical notation).
				<br>
				<br>
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Role Types</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>There are a number of standard role types in Zaju that define the shapes of characters. There is the sheng (the main male character, often a young scholars seeking to pass the imperial exams), the dan (the main female character, often a beautiful young woman and the main love interest of the sheng), the chou (the clown).</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Wang Shifu</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Very little is known about Wang Shifu. The only thing known about him in the latter part of the 14th century was that he was from Dadu (or Beijing). West and Idema suggests that he was probably a professional playwright, given the number of very good plays he wrote. Some have contested that he was most active from around 1297 until 1307, but this late date seems unlikley ecause it isn't clear why people around them seemed to know so little about him. Traditionally, people have argued that he was active sometime between 1230 and 1300.</aside></section>
