				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Theaters of Desire</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>
				Let's spends some time talking about the things that Patricia Sieber brings up in the chapter I assigned from her book Theaters of desire, which focuses on commentaries written about The Story of the Western Wing, and waht this tells us about how the work was recieved at various points in history. Can anyone sum up the arguments she makes really quickly for me?
				<br>
				<br>
				She begins by discussing Guo Moruo, an important intellectual thinker during the May 4th movement, who was interested in making sure the Story was not relegated to the dustbins of history because of some percieved erotic content. He wrote the preface to a vernacular edition of the drama to be published in Shanghai in the very early 20th century. He noted the evolution of depictions of love in the drama, away from "A sublim state of mind" to "erotic passion" as Sieber puts it (thogh we haven't gotten quite that far in the drama yet).
				<br>
				<br>
				Guo took a Freudian approach, tying the sexual events in the novel with the author's own supposed sexual nature. Read bottom of first page "When we carefully read the XIxiang ji...."
				<br>
				<br>
				Yet Guo's focus is on the author, wherease more contemporary commentators, who wanted to put their own spins on the novel, were less concerned about the author and more focused on the nature of the readers. "Their misgivings about 'obscenity' derived from the nera-universal dissemination of the play among all strata of the population from the Yuan period on."
				<br>
				<br>
				Sieber points out the ubiquity of the performance of the play in both private and public venues, even as the music that backed the play fell out of style, it was readapted into other formats. I did see if I could find an origial performace of the play, but the only versions I could track down were southern-style Kunqu versions.
				<br>
				<br>
				She points to Wang Jide's 1614 edition of the novel and Jin Shengtan's 1656 version, whcih he called the sixth book of genius. Interestingly, by calling it this he links it to other very important works (including the Water Margin, which he called the fifth book of Genius).
				<br>
				<br>
				Their ideal readership was clear, but slightly different. On page 125, Sieber says "Both Wnag and Jin..."
				<br>
				<br>
				So obscenty then becomes linked to "proper and imporpoer channels of circulation, rather than as a quality inherint in a writer, a musical piece, or a text."
				<br>
				<br>
				There were several dozen editions of the play, some meant to be performed and others to be read.
				<br>
				<br>
				Commercial vs literati editions.
				<br>
				<br>
				This was a very common book among commercial publishers
				<br>
				<br>
				Let's talk breifly about bibliographic classification, and what this tells us about how a particlar genre of text was onderstood. On page 132 Sieber says "Given teh intensly genre-oriente structure.."
				<br>
				<br>
				So where does the Xixiang ji fit here? "Contrary to what we may assume..."
				<br>
				<br>
				So was the Xixiang ji licentious? This was omething that had to be dealt with, and one that literati editions of the novel were particularly concerned with. ON page 134: Sieber notes "in the other preface to that same edition..."
				<br>
				<br>
				He bi argued qing was the central concern of the play. 135: In his 1616 literati edition...

				<section><h2>Play 2 and Action</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>
				So we talked about this last time, but I realized over the weekend that the reading for today was actually this act, so this gives us some opportunity to look at this play up close and think a bit about what is happening, the relation with historical events, and how the descriptions in this play line up (or don't line up) with what we've seen in this class so far. I think this is particularly important because I really quickly glossed over the events that unfolded with the General and the Bandit!
				<br>
				<br>
				On page 149 we are introduced to Flying Tiger Sun (Sun Feihu). Let's look at his introductory monologue. (Read). There are a few things to take into considertaion. First is this style of introducing characters with a monologue and a clear exposition on ones motivations. What do you think of this? How would you compare this to how characters are introduced in other stories?
				<br>
				<br>
				Here we have a fairly classic military villian. How would you compare him with characters like Cao Cao in the Romance of the Three kingdoms?
				<br>
				<br>
				What are the implications for the nature of governance here? "When the commander-in-chief is not acting right, why should I alone be incorruptible?"
				<br>
				<br>
				Do you think this is a convincing depiction of a historical figure? (He isn't really, but he is meant to encapsulate the nature of a local bandite).
				<br>
				<br>
				What do you make of the juxtaposition between scenes of the inner quaters, which show the characters reacting to the events unfolding around them, and the descriptions of the military events themselves? Particularly, what do you make of the gap in time between when we as the audience know about Sun Biao and his intentions, and the moment Oriole discovers it? On 152, after all, she sings "Normallly whenever I saw a stranger..."
				<br>
				<br>
				We get a glimpse of Oriole's self sacrificial attitude when they hatch the first plan to react to this. On page 154, the Old lady speaks: I am already sixty years old...
				<br>
				<br>
				We talked about this last time, but let's take a look again at Oriole's other plan: "Whosoever it may be if he establishes meritorious service..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Zhang Sheng sets about a plan: first delay. On page 156: "(Old lady speaks:... to page 158 and Flying Tiger's response" How does this plan compare with the sorts of plans we seen in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or in the Journey to the West?
				<br>
				<br>
				They need to find a letter to get to General Du who is at Pu Pass nearby. What do you think of this specificity? What would it be like if they had made this more anonymouse by not mentioning a sepecific name, or just saying that the army is "nearby" instead of 45 li away at Pu Pass?
				<br>
				<br>
				They get a monk to cary a letter, who wants only to drink and fight. Let's read this monk's songs together on page 159 (I do not recite the Lotus Sutra)
				<br>
				<br>
				The abbot is worried he wno't go, but he responss on page 160 "why do you ask oif I dare or not..." What do you make of what this implies about Buddhism here? About his judgement of the Bandit?
				<br>
				<br>
				We have a description of the plan on 161: "I'll have several small acoloytes"
				<br>
				<br>
				On page 162 we get the introductino of General Du. Note the discussion of Student Zhang un prompted here.
				<br>
				<br>
				Let's also take a look at the letter itself on page 164.
				<br>
				<br>
				Benevolent berates the general on page 165: That lout plunders the black haired citizens...
				What do you think of this?
				<br>
				<br>
				ON page 166 Du Que has arrived "I du que have failed"
				<br>
				<br>
				On 166 there is discussion of how to punish the rebel. (After they have taken the rebel...)
