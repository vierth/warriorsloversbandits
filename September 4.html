					<p>September 4th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Lectures available <a href="https://vierth.github.io/warriorsloversbandits/">here</a></section>
				<section><h2>Bi-syllabic Last Names</h2><aside class='notes'>There are very few bi-syllabic last names in modern China: Ouyang, Sima, Situ, and Xiahou though only Ouyang is relatively common. IN the olden days tere were many more of these bi syllabic names: Ximen, Gongsun, Zhuge, etc.</aside></section>
				<section><h2><a href='pvierth.com/sangram'>Three Kingdoms N-gram viewer</a></h2><aside class='notes'>As we go through this class, it is always worth asking what sorts of questions can we research in Chinese studies. If I am a scholar interested in how people talked about their past, what sorts of questions might I elect to ask. Are there any suggestions on this?</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>Can someone sum up what Plaks is saying in this article for me?</p><p>History of the first edition. I mentioned last time that the earliest edition dates from 1522 but there may have been earlier ones. Plaks argues that the 16th century edition is probably a transformative edition that may have been significnatly different than something that Luo Guanzhong wrote. Note that this opens up space for Mao Zonggang, who we also mentioned last time, to claim that he is restoring an older edition of the novel.</p><p>371: Top of the page "But when one reviews the extant plays...</p><p>Plaks argues that the San guo owes far more to the earlier historiographical materials than it does to contemporary materials that cove similar content (plays and short story cycles)</p><p>373 (top): We must again bear in mind...</p><p>374 middle: Much f the critical discusion on is it faithful or not</p><p>Plak's central argument is that the Sanguo is an ironic rewritting of all of the source materials</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Language in the Three Kingdoms</h2></section>
				<section data-background-iframe="resources/stylosmall.html" data-background-interactive></section>
				<section><h2>Chapters 20 to 40, generally speaking</h2>
				<aside class='notes'><p>At this point in then novel, Cao Cao controls the emperor and thus the imperial court. He is also commanding some of his rivals, while others are not near enough to cause any trouble</p><p>Yet Cao Cao uses an imperial bow at a hunt, which upsets the actual emperor who asks Dong Cheng to take care of Cao Cao.</p><p>Liu Bei is tasked with offing Cao Cao and gets close but doesn't do it. Yuan Shao kills Gongsun Zan, who had mentored Liu Bei in other parts of the novel, so Liu wants to take care of him. Liu kills Yuan Shu (Yuan Shao's brother) but Cao Cao no longer has Liu nearby and sends someone to kill him, but Guan Yu stops it</p>
				<p>At this point, Liu decides to join up with Yuan Shao to avoid being killed by Cao Cao</p>
				<p>In Chapter 24, Cao Cao kills Dong Cheng and his family and starts actively guarding the Emperor. Guan Yu gets seperated from Liu Bei and Zhang Fei at this point, and Liu Bei loses a battle against Cao Cao (Yuan Shao who should have helped didn't as his son was sick).</p>
				<p>Chapter 25 we will discuss in detail, but Guan Yu is captured by Cao Cao</p>
				<p>Guan Yu fights for Cao Cao until he hears where Liu Bei is and then he bails. Cao Cao respects Guan's honor so lets him go, but doesn't provide him with any documentaiton, so Guan Yu runs into all sorts of trouble.</p>
				<p>Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are reunited, but Zhang Fei tthinks guan yu is a traitor because he was working for CC. GY kills some CC officers to show he never betryaed them. Liu Bei bails on Yuan Shao and they are finally back together. Zhao Zilong joins them!</p>
				<p>At this point, Sun Ce (one of the eventual founders of Wu on e of the three kingdoms) jumps back in the action and plans to fight Cao Cao and Yuan Shao. Sun Ce is attacked and wounded before anything can happen. In the meantime he kilsl a sorcerer and is haunted by his ghosts, which eventually kills him but leaves everything to Sun Quan his brother</p>
				<p>Yuan Shao attacks CC, but because he is a poor commander he eventually loses. Yuan tries to grogrpu and Cao Cao pursues. Liu Bei decides to try to take over the capitol but fails when CC comes back. Liu Biao then lets Liu Bei hang out with ihm. CC goes after Yuan Shao again, who dies soon after. His heirs fight after he appoints his younger rather than his older son as heir</p><p>CC finishes them off</p>
				<p>Liu Bei is with Liu Biao, and LBiao's inlaws stir up trouble (which we will see in detail)</p>
				<p>Liu Bei escapes a murder attempt and begins to recruit good advisors. Liu Biao is upset at his family and LB forgives him, helps defeat a CC atatck</p>
				<p>Liu Bei adopts a son, which Guan Yu is pretty upset about</p>
				<p>Liu tries to find Zhuge Liang, who eventually advises Liu to form a kingdom (the third to go alogn with Cao's Wei and Sun's Wu.</p><p>Some of Liu Biao's allies are killed and Biao wants to send LB out to the east, but Liu Bei is afraid of upseting the Suns so does not. Instead he goes to the north to defend against CC, where Zhuge's amazing military strategy defeats a much larger army.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 25</h2><aside class='notes'>
				<p>Why did I select this chapter?</p>
				<p>pg 613: the three offences of Guan Yu. Note that this results in a negotiation. The conditions are important.</p> <p>pg 619: Cao Cao attempts to drive a wedge between Guan Yu and Liu Bei by putting Guan Yu and Liu Bei's wives in the same room. Guan Yu refuses to enter. Cao Cao respects this.</p>
				<p>pg 623: Unfurling the beard</p>
				<p>623: Red Hare as a gift, a poem. What do you make of this?</p>
				<p>625: intrigue: Guan Yu wants to repay cc but they decide to make this hard on him</p>
				<p>627: Tian Feng a strategist that recommends caution, Yuan Shao and Liu Bei decide against it. Tian is unhapy and Yuan wants to execute him, but Liu Bei saves him. What do you make of this?</p>
				<p>629: Guan Yu is sent out against Yuan Shao's army (not knowing that Liu Bei is with them). Cao Cao uses this to manipulate them, thinking if Guan can defeate Yan Liang, Yuan Shao will turn on Liu bei</p>
				<p>631: it worked! Yan Liang's defeated force...</p>
				<p>631 note the cliff hanger and then the immediate resolution on the next page...</p></aside>

				<section><h2>Chapter 34</h2><aside class='notes'><p>819: begins with an omen (read)</p>
				<p>819: "Among them only Cao Zhi was adept at composition.." Interestingly Cao Pi may have written the first ever seven syllable Chinese poem, a style that would become extremely important during the Tang Dynastys</p>
				<p>821/823: Liu Bei's plan to send out his bros and Zhao Zilong is impeded by court intrigue. The "marked horse" and Liu Bei's reaction to it are very interesting. "All men have their time, and ahorse can't change it"</p>
				<p>825: an omen upon the Birth of Liu Bei's son</p>
				<p>827: talk of successsion. this is importnat and goes to the nature of governance and imperial legitimacy</p>
				<p>827: talk of aging</p>
				<p>827/829: getting drunk and saying too much. Also, the poem</p>
				<p>829: Note the interference by Lady Cai, who secretely orders Liu Bei killd. this is related to the scapegoating of eunuchs and women. Think about how this information would have been known. Could it have been in the history? Is it novelistic invention? these are important to consider.</p>
				<p>829: Yi Ji warns LB about the plot, but LB can't leave without saying goodbye to his host, but he is convinced to leave</p>
				<p>829: seditious poetry, and Liu Biao's reaction</p>
				<p>831 backup plan is to invite LB to a banquet, but he recognizes it might be a trap, brings troops for protection</p>
				<p>833: riding the marked horse</p>
				<p>835: The escape and dash across the river poem</p>
