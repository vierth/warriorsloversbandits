				<section><h1>Warriors, Lovers, and Adventurers</h1>
					<p>November 4th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Western Chamber Wrap Up</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Sadly we missed the most salacious parts of the Western Chamber, but we should spend a bit of time wrapping up what happened in the last two acts of the play.
				<br>
				<br>
				Play 4 sees the Student Zhang and Oriole consumate their relationship, and unlike in other texts, the Western Wing gets fairly explicit about what happens. We can see on page 228 it happen, and lets talk about it. (read from top to mid 229).
				<br>
				<br>
				Oriole's mother quickly discovers the afffair and berates crimson (235 read) "You hussy, you're responsible..." But she agrees to have them married provided he goes and passs the exams.
				<br>
				<br>
				Zhang quickly passes the exams (after six months) and hopes to go see Oriole but he is quickly appointed to an official position which prevents him from imediately going back.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the meantime, Oriole is promised to Zheng Heng again, who has arrived to inquire after the marriage, and he claims that Student ZHang has now been married to someone else.
				<br>
				<br>
				Zhang gets back to try to marry oriole but conflict now arises. On page 278 we see Zhang speak with madame cui (153b read)
				<br>
				<br>
				The final gathering happens around page 283 everyone gets on stage to act out the finale. General Du accouses Zheng Heng of treatchery, and he gives up his claim to the marriage. Page 285 concludes with line 160b...
				<br>
				<br>
				Thoughts on this?

				<section><h2>The Water Margin</h2>
				<h2>Outlaws of the Marsh</h2>
				<h2>All Men are Brothers</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>This is one of the so called four classic novels of imperial China, along with the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and the Dream of the read chamber. Unlike the Three Kingdoms, the water margin was written in vernacular Chinese and tells the story of how a group of bandits gathered at Liang Shan marsh.
					<br>
					<br>
				They were lead by the bandit Song Jiang. The exploits that are described in the novel are almost entirely fictional and emerged as part of folk retellings of stories that were first told during the Song dynasty. This being said, Song Jiang himeself was a historical figure who did lead an uprising against the emperor Huizong of the Song.
				<br>
				<br>
				There are multiple endings to the novel, depending on which version you read, which depend pretty heavily on the given editor's opinions about the message of the novel. In some verisons, the bandits end up defending the dynasty and are eventually pardoned. In other versions, they are executed for their treachery to the kingdom.
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Shi Nai'an</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>The Water Margin is attributed to a man named Shi Nai'an, although it is not clear who actually wrote the novel (as we've mentioned on numerous occasions in this calss, early novels were not well regarded and it wasn ot importnat to establish firm authorhip.
					<br>
					<br>
				Some people claim that Shi Nai'an was a teach of Luo Guanzhong and that Luo may have edited the water margin (though this is pretty unlikely).
				<br>
				<br>
				Supposedly Shi lived from around 1296 until 1372, though we know basically nothing about him. 
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Song Dynasty</h2><img src='resources/song.jpg' style='max-width: 45%;'><p style='font-size: .25em;'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:China_-_Song_Dynasty_-_cs.svg#/media/File:China_11a.jpg</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
					While it was written during the Ming dynasty (or possibly the late Yuan), the novel is set in the Song dynasty. The Song was one of the longer dynsaties and ran from 960 to 1279. It was established after the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms which occured after the fall of the Tang dynasty.
					<br>
					<br>
					Like the Han dynasty, the Song dynasty is divided into two periods. The first half was the NOrther Song, because the capital was in modern day Kaifeng (960-1127), and the Southern Song with its capital in modern day Hangzhou (1127-1279)
					<br>
					<br>
					The song saw significant scientific and govermental innovatoins, with the invention of gunpowde, more extensive printing, and the invention of moveable type.
					<br>
					<br>
					There was also lots of innovation in culture, with the development of newer literary genres

				<section><h2>108 Bandits</h2>
				<h2>36 Heavenly Spirits</h2>
				<h2>72 Earthly Demons</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>This novel, unlike the others we have read, is centrally character driven. There are 108 bandits, and we get a greater or lesser amount of information about each one, depending on where they figure into the overall picture of the novel's ideas about prominence. The most important characters, which get most of the stage time are the so called 36 heavely spirits, while the rest of the bandits are earthly demons. As you know, the novel opens with them let out of the temple in which they are locked.
				<br>
				<br>
				Not all of them get much screen time, but the novel begins with the adventures that lead them to Liang Shan marsh. In most cases, this shows what they end up doing to deserve exile. 
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Shuihu Zhuan and Military Subculture</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Paul Jakov Smith introduces some importnat ideas about the water margin in his article on military subculture in the Northern Song dynasty. The first is that this novel is fairly unique in the range of characters it presents. because it is about bandits, it discusses people who lived all different layers of society, from the lowest of the low all the way up to the emperor himself.
				<br>
				<br>
				He starts by focusing on arms instructors, and on page 365 he points out that "As Gao Qiu's first victim..."
				<br>
				<br>
				The important point here is that there are arms instrcutures distributed and multiple levels in society, and they tend to be there to help local lords at the manorial elvel (the focus of much of the action in the novel).
				<br>
				<br>
				There is an obsessive focus on martial arts among many of the characters and Smith argues on page 369 that Shajin perfectly embodies this...
				<br>
				<br>
				Smith argues that the patronage networks we see in this novel place them on a border between officialdom (which they ostensibly serve) and outlaws (which they have a fraternal bond to).
				<br>
				<br>
				The manorial organization of much of society plays an importnat role as well, as local aristocrats started to accumulate estates in the Song that required defense (thoguh scholars argue about how well the novel presents this system). On Page 375 smith asks "But would large landowneers..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Smith argues that the Water Margin actually reflects the Song dynasty more than perhaps even the Ming dynasty. On page 420 he argues that "Nevertheless, althought Shuihu..." 
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 1</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Opening Poem: "After Five Dynasties..."
				<br>
				<br>
				There is an interesting focus on the oriigns of the emperor: Page 8: "In time, the way of Heaven took..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Eventually an emepror abdicates and passes the throne toa  Marshall Zhao: Page 9: "Marsha Zhao accepted the abidication..."
				<br>
				<br>
				For much of his early reign things went really well, but eventually a plague struck: Page 9: "Zhao Zhe, the Premier..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Nothing they did helped, but eventaully they sent out Marshall Hong to find the divine teacher of the Daoists and ask him for help. He goes to the mountains to find him, but proves to be not the best messengar in the world. He finds the monstary wher ethe teacher lives but the teacher is not there at the time. He asks the daoists to get him, but they tell him he is moving about the mountian and they hve no way of contacting him. On page 11 Hong says "I must meet him. A plague is raging..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Page 11: "Bidding the Daoists farewell and..."
				<br>
				<br>
				On his way up he encounters a tiger, a snake, and eventually a young boy who tells him teh master is off to say a prayer that will stop the plague. Hong quickly gives up, feeling that it is beneath him to be on teh mountain and he is not in very good physical shape.
				<br>
				<br>
				He comes down to find out that the young boy was in fact the divine taecher, bbut the daoists figure since he said that the teacher offered the prayer then all is good. They have a feast and he rests. Soon however, on page 13 "He was then escorted to the ground..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Hong forces them to unlock the temple so he can see inside and they find a stone with the inscription "open when hong comes." He makse them open it. 14: "Then they started shovelling..."
				<br>
				<br>
				14: Emperor Ren zong ruled for fourty years...
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 2</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>This second chapter tells us the Story of Gao Qiu (gao the ball) who impresses the crown prince with his abilities at playing a game of football. There are hints that he is not trustworthy, and eventually this leads to issues. But at first it seems like he will be in the clear. Once the crown prince becomes the emperor he puts Gao Qiu in charge of some troops. Among these troops is an arms instructure, a Wnag Jin. Gao had previoulsy been in a fight with Wang's father and accuses Wang of crime when he doesn't show up for muster because he is sick. Wang figures that all he csn do is run off with his mother to the borderlands, which he does. On the way he gets to a manor where the local lord allows them to stay so his mother can recover form an illness she picks up. While there, he encounters Shi Jin, the lord's son. On page 23 "But enough of petty details." What do you make of this interaction?
				<br>
				<br>
				Eventually Wang Jin heads to the border, and the lord dies, leaving Shi Jin in charge. Yet Shi is obssed with mariality and ignroes the estate to practice his arts. Eventaully some local bandits consider plundering the estate and he stops them, but respects their collegiality so much that he lets htem off the hook. Eventually it appears as if he is colluding with them adn he gets in trouble for it, which will eventually lead to his branding as a bandit.
