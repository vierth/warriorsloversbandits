				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Emperor Hui Zong</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>I had hoped to have you read a biography of emperor huizong before coming to calss today from the history of the song, but I wasn't able to track down a good translation of it, but I'd like to talk about him anyway so we can discuss some of the historical background in which this novel is set
				<br>
				<br>
				Emperor Huizong is perhaps most widely known as the emperor who allowed the jurchens to take over northern china, and for this reason he has been vilified in a lot of later periods. modern scholars have been working against this attitude (patricia ebrey in particular has been trying focus on the things he tried to do)
				<br>
				<br>
				He was born in 1082 and died in 1135. He was the emperror between 1100 and 1126, when he was forced to abdicate the throne.
				<br>
				<br>
				He was known as an excellent calligrapher and patron of the arts. He was famous for the way he promoted poetry, daoism, and usc
				<br>
				<br>
				He was the 11th son of the Shenzong emperor and thus didn ot really expect to become emperor, but he did when emperor zhezhong died, because zhezong's heir had also already died.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Water margin becomes a commentary on the issues of the time (and through that, a commentary on the issues of the yuan and the ming dynsty). Because huizong was generally regarded as incompent, contemporary people viewed him as allowing the bandits around the country to flourish.

				<section><h2>The Water Margin and Violence</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>You may have found the violence in this novel somewhat shocking in its suddenness. What are all of your thoughts on this? We will be encountering quite a bit of this sort of thing throughout the novel.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sex and Violence in the Water Margin
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 20</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Can anyone tell me generally what happened here?
				<br>
				<br>
				The chapter opens with an attempt to establish a hierarchy at Liangshan. Let's read the opening few pieces ot this chapter together "Still clutching the dagger..." What jumps out to youhere?
				<br>
				<br>
				Love is an interesting thing in the Shuihu and something that is missing through most of it. When it does happen it is often discussed in terms of loss (and this seperation from love and family is part of what keeps the leaders of the bandits heterodox): "One day, seeing how generously Chao Gao"
				<br>
				<br>
				Note the militarized structure of life at Laingshan, and how it mimics offical structures of military might. But it still, in some way reflects normal society.
				<br>
				<br>
				A central locus of action in this chapter is on repelling District Garrison Commander Huang An who is leading troops from Jizhou, but Huang is captrued. "The brigand leaders and their l"
				<br>
				<br>
				Order is essentially maintained (and operations funded) in Liangshan via pillaging, but there is a curious compassion for the people they rob: "Zhu Gui has heard"
				<br>
				<br>
				We are eventually introduced to Song Jiang (who has appeared in fan earlier chapter for helping Zhao Gui and Lin Chong excape from the police). "When the prefectural order..."
				<br>
				<br>
				Song Jiang is set up with a young woman as a wife "The next day mistress Wang"
				<br>
				<br>
				She rapidly starts an affair with Song's assistant Zhang "One day he brought his assistant"
				<br>
				<br>
				There is an illiciting meeting at night when he runs into Liu Tang, a bandit with Chao Gui, who gives hims ome gold and a lteter
				<br>
				<br>
				Song has been avoiding his "wife" and her mother doesn't like this.
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 21</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>
				This chapter sets quite a different scene than the last, which opened with a focus on military affairs. "As song jiang ambled"
				<br>
				<br>
				Neither of the two want much to do with the other. "Song Jiang entered and sat down on a bench"
				<br>
				<br>
				"The girls room was fairly large"
				<br>
				<br>
				"But Poxi refused to sit by Song Jiang"
				<br>
				<br>
				The mother tries to ge tthem to drink but it does not work. Eventaully they both start to appease her, but are none to happy about ti. "She filled the three cups"
				<br>
				<br>
				In the meantime Mistress Yen gets drunk herself
				<br>
				<br>
				"While this was going on, Tang the Ox..." He is coming for money but Song sees a way of getting out but the old lady see sthrough it.
				<br>
				<br>
				"Dog farts!"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Tang the Ox bawled from the yard"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Song Jiang pulled up the edge of his over"
				<br>
				<br>
				Poxi threatens to blackmail him and in a fit of rage Song Jiang kills her.
				<br>
				<br>
				At first it seems like the mother is going to let him get away with it, but she tricks him and starts yelling that he murdered her daughter in front of the magistrate.
				<br>
				<br>
				"Song Jiang's prestige was so high...""
				<br>
				<br>
				No one can quite believe that Song would kill anyone and he is able to slip away in the confusion. Tang the Ox, however, is accused of the crime and tortured.
