				<section><h1>Warriors, Lovers, and Adventurers</h1>
					<p>November 13th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>I do want to spend most of today in discussion, as we are wrapping up the water margin, and i think it woudl be valuable to get our impressions of it and how you think it realtes tot he other texts we've read in class.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 75</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>The emperor wants to offer amnesty as the bandits have been riling things up and he sees this as a way to settle things.
				<br>
				<br>
				"As Marshal Chen was preparing"
				<br>
				<br>
				Cai JIng is one of the primary antagoinsts "I hear the emperor is sending you to Mount Liangshan"
				<br>
				<br>
				Gao says "If I had been present when the imperial court was considering an amnesty"
				<br>
				<br>
				"in my humble opinion, it's the best solution"
				<br>
				<br>
				"The next day the prefecture sent a man"
				<br>
				<br>
				teh bottles of liquor are there to ease things so keep your eye out for them
				<br>
				<br>
				The bandits don't buy that amnesty is going to happen.
				<br>
				<br>
				"The procession was greeted by the welcoming part, who prostrated themselves"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Seated on the prow of his vessel, Ruan"
				<br>
				<br>
				Funny stuff hapens. "Two swift craft were seen to approach" (keep going through the wine story)
				<br>
				<br>
				"The marshal is a high official of the imperial court"
				<br>
				<br>
				"It was the fourth lunar month, nad they were wearing light battle robes... Xiao rang finished reading..."
				<br>
				<br>
				"Your emperor doesn't understand anything about us bold fellows here"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Song Jiang returned to loyalty hall"
				<br>
				<br>
				"At the morning the next day, high officials waited on the imperial stairs"

				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>In the meantime</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Between these two chapters, the imperial go vt sends out troops to curtail the bandits, but the bandits defeat them and eventaully the emperor decides to offer them amnesty anyway, and then they start to fight for the government, and Song plays the official who never meant to do any harm.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 100</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>The main focus of this chapter is tying up all of the loose ends, and note what happens to the bandits (even though they have been fighting in service of the empire). "Dai Zong rose and said to Song Jiang"
						<br>
						<br>
				"Ruan the Seventh, When he received his appotinment"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Claiming that he could not function"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Li Ying"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Guan Sheng" etc (discuss)
				<br>
				<br>
				"Why do we tell of these latter three only up until..."
				<br>
				<br>
				"When Tai Zong succeeded Tai Zu"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Have a couple of Luzhou military men"
				<br>
				<br>
			
				They brought their complaints to the emperor: "when Song Jiang and Lu Junyi smashed the Liao Tartars"
				<br>
				<br>
				"The emperor chatted with Lu until nearly noon"
				<br>
				<br>
				"The monarch thought for some time."
				<br>
				<br>
				We also get a preface about Song Jiang's fate: "It happened that the man was a trusted crony of Gao and Yang"
				<br>
				<br>
				"During the first ten days of summer..."
				<br>
				<br>
				"Song Jiang's stomach began to pain him soon after"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Since childhood I studied Confucianism"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Song Jiang escorted Black Whirlwind"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Brother, don't blame me!"
				<br>
				<br>
				"As Black Whirlwind lay dying"
				<br>
				<br>
				"After only a few cups, he felt very sleepy"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Although I at one tie fought against"
				<br>
				<br>
				"I dreamt that Song Jiang came to my home"
				<br>
				<br>
				"Those who defend their country and protect the people"
