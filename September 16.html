				<section><h1>Warriors, Lovers, and Adventurers</h1>
					<p>September 16th</p></section>
				<section><h2>Questions from Last Time</h2></section>
				<section><h2>History as Metamorphosis</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Frank Ankersmit is a famous historian and philsopher of history who deals with what it rhetorical means to write a history. He is probably most famous for his work "The Invention of Tradition" in which he discusses how cultures tend to invent tradition in a somewhat contingent and haphazard manner</aside></section>
				<section><blockquote>Many experiments were made before I could hit the middle tone between a dull chronicle and a rhetorical declamation: three times did I compose the first chapter, and twice the second and third, efore I was tolerably satisfied with their effect."</blockquote><aside class='notes'><p>This is gibbon discussing how he wrote his historical work the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</p> <p>Ankersmit says that "few historians have paid more attention to their style and the 'effect it might have on the reader..." "Style is not merely a matter of representationbut also determines the content of narrative.</p><p>Content is linked throughout Gibbon's work by irony</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Metahistory</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Hayden White's Metahistory has argued that "Tropes" that are used ina historical work reveal assumptions about the nature o fhistory. These are metaphor, metonymy, synechdoche, and irony.</p><p>Irony was the focus of Gibbon, which Hayden White says "The Decline and Fall" tends to be ironic in its creation of disingenuous relationship etween writer and reader." Gibbon i focused on the 'crimes and follies in the history of mankind with a toungue in cheek irony in which oly the Enlightenment historian could and so much liked to indulge."</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Fielding and Gibbion, Fiction and History</h2><aside class='notes'><p>108 "However, there is anohter less coventional..."</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Ovid and Gibbon</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Ankersmit argues that there are structural similarity between the metamorphasis and Gibbon's history that reveals things that arent obvious in Gibbon</p><p>"THe more the historian's story is an acceptable substitute for the past itself, the less reason do we ahve to value the past itself."</p></aside></section>
				<section><blockquote>And we may say that historians always have to discover the right balance between merely echoing the past (like Echo), and the other extreme of becoming fascinated by their own image as it is reflected by the past (as was the case with Narcisssus).</blockquote></section>
				<section><h2>Rome as Narcisssus</h2></section>
				<section><blockquote>...Gibbon sees in history a permanent propensity toward a Narcissistic mimesis of a previous original world, where each mimesis (or signifier) is always an alienation and a corruption of the signified in which it had its origin.</blockquote><aside class='notes'>Here we are getting quite close to discussion late imperial commentors were having about the nature of history and its relationship with fiction</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Fall as a Parenthetical</h2><aside class='notes'>115 midway down the page "The way he deals with the fall of the Wsetern empire in 476 is characteristic..." Think about events in the three kingdoms. The actual fall of the Han dynasty is buried amid the action in the middle of the novel</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Metamorphosis of Rome</h2></section>
				<section><h2>Why is this pertinent?</h2><aside class='notes'>Why do you think I wanted you all to read this? Interestingly, this period is about the same time as the events in China!</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Novel So Far</h2><aside class='notes'><p>So last time we left off with Liu Bei's troops having jsut tricked Zhou Yu and conquered Nan Chun</p>
				<p>At this point Liu Bei starts to actually accumulate a little bit of territory, almost entirely of the backs of Zhuge Liang's strategic prowess.</p>
				<p>Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are able to take over some of Cao Cao's cityies and then eventually a province each. </p>
				<p>Sun Quan marries his sister Liu Bei hoping to establish an aliance and trick him. They get married and she sides with Liu bei against the Sun.</p>
				<p>Cao Cao recieves someone from Wu at this point who hopes that they can set Cao against Liu by formally giving land to Zhou Yu that Liu Bei controls. Liu doesn't give it up and Zhou Yu tries to trick him into allowing an army in but is foiled and injured. Zhou Yu dies shortly thereafter</p>
				<p>By chapter 60 there are almost no independent warloards left, and the three kingdoms are forming.</p>
				<p>Liu Bei starts to set up in Shu but won't dispose of kinsmen who plot against him. Eventually however, Liu Zhang and Liu Bei do battle. Liu Bei is rescured by Zhuge liang and Zhang Fei.</p>
				<p>By Chapter 65 Liu controls Shu and we fully have three kingdoms.</p>
				<p>In 214 Cao Cao disposes of the empress family and makes his daughter the empress.</p>
				<p>Liu bei makes overatures to Wu and returns some land in return for them invading Wei (which is unsuccessful</p>
				<p>Cao Cao becomes king of Wei in Chapter 68</p>
				<p>Zhang Fei helps Liu Bei consolidate and they start to defeaut Cao Cao.</p>
				<p>In Chapter 72 Cao and Liu both lead their armies against each other and it looks dire for Cao. He loses the battle.</p>
				<p>Liu Bei is made king of Shu in chapter 73 but Cao Cao and Wu form an alliance after Guan Yu refuses a marriage with a Sun.</p>
				<p>Guan Yu must defeat Fan if they want to win, but it doesn't work and we start to see the heros flaw: Guan Yu's opinion of himself.</p></aside></section>

				<section><h2>Chapter 77</h2><aside class='notes'><p>Here we start to see the true dissolution of the sworn brotherhood between Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei.</p>
				<p>Shu has been rising fairly steadily to this point in the novel, but things take a drastic turn. Think about the sorts of characteristics that cause this, and how the author of the text using characters to make meaning. We can see that had Guan Yu listened to Wang Fu's warnings, then things would not be nearly so bad (page 190)</p>
				<p>So the Sun's lay out a plan to capture Guan Yu. READ 190: first two paragraphs</p>
				<p>191: Wang Fu opposed it... Guan Yu had JUST gotten done complaining that he should have listed to Wang, yet here he is again ignoring him</p>
				<p>191 bottom: "With half a score of men..." What do you think of this landscape description at the moment of Guan's capture?</p>
				<p>192: Read to bottom (lots of good stuff here)</p>
				<p>Red hare refuses to eat and also dies</p>
				<p>Wang Fu has a dream that Guan Yu was covered in gore</p>
				<p>193 mid page: "Just then the men of Wu..." Shu generals elect to throw themselves off the wall. What do you make of this?</p>
				<p>193: The afterlife of Guan Yu, read in full</p>
				<p>195 mid page: "Then he filled the goblet..."</p>
				<p>They fear Liu Bei will attack, so they hatch a plan to send the head to Cao Cao and make it seem like he did it.</p>
				<p>196 bottom: "I think escape is easy..." Think about the nature of ritual here.</p>
				<p>At this point, Wu and Wei know of Guan Yu's death, but Shu does not. 197 bottom: The land of shu is prospering</p>
				<p>198: But evil tidings were on the way...</p>
				<p>199 bottom: poem</p>
				</aside></section>
				<section><h2>78-84</h2><aside class='notes'><p>A lot happen between these two chapters, Cao Cao gets sick and dies, Cao Pi deposes the Emperor, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei determined to get revenge, Zhang Fei gets really drunk and some of his oficers murder him and turn to the Suns.</p></aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chapter 85</h2><aside class='notes'><p>275: "It was the sixth month..."</p>
				<p>276: But a poem has been written ubraiding Huang Quan:...</p>
				<p>Cao Pi ask his generals who he should go after first, Shu or Wu and they say hold your horses. In the end, however, Cao has already sent out troops against Wu and decides to press on.</p>
				<p>277 top: "He then led the Imperial Guards..." So have you noticed a theme? What happens when a king doesn't listen to his generals?</p>
			<p>277 mid page, halfway through third paragraph "Success depends upon the leader..."</p>
			<p>278: "Meanwhile the First Ruler was failing" Cover whole page</p>
			<p>279: "Turning his head..." Liu Bei to his last ignoring Zhuge Liang</p>
			<p>279: "You are many times more clever than Cao Pi...</p>
			<p>280: After my death...</p>
			<p>280: Turning to Zhao Yun</p>
			<p>280: Then he turned to the others... to end of ppoem</p>
			<p>What do you think of the deaths of the sworn brothers? How are the similar or different?</p>
			<p>Wei decides whether or not to attack. The generals against, but Sima Yi says hey when etter? They decide to send five armies to attack</p>
			<p>In the meantime Zhuge liang is refusing to see peopel and the emperor is getting frightened. Eventually he goes to see ZHuge himself and discovers Kongming is already deep in planning mode. He can stop four of the five armies but needs someone who can stop the fifth</p>
			<p>285: "now kong ming had noticed..."</p></aside></section>
