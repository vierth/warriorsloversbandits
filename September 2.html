				<section><h2>Early imperial history</h2></section>
				<section><a href="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/timelines/china_timeline.htm">Timeline for Chinese History</a>
					<aside class="notes">Here we can see the early history of China. The oldest times, the Xia were largely legendary, and the Shang marks the emregence of writing, often in the form of oracle bones and ritual wares. We'll be talking a bit about these in the other class. While this period is generally regarded as a dynasty, it was a lose conglomeration of independent states. It wasn't until the Qin dynasty that the whole of China was unified under one government. This particular dynasty subscribed to the legalist philosophy, which was the idea that one needed maintain control of the realm through harsh punishments and rich rewards. It only lasted through a single emperor, and essentially fell during the second empororer's reign. The Han Dynasty was established and lasted for four hundred years (with a brief interrignum from 9 to 25 AD. </aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Fall of the Han Dynasty</h2><aside class='notes'>By the late 2nd century there were an increasing number of revolts and the government was progresively less able to contain them.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Chen Shou and the Records of the Three Kingdoms</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>233-297. Lived in the kingdom of Shu but was exiled eventually for not showing deference to Huang Hao, a eunuch who worked for the second emporor of Shu. He was able to find work after the founding of the Jin dynasty, which was the dynasty that was founded after the uniificaiton of the three kingdoms. Note that official histories were produced after the start of the next dynasty. Chen wrote a lot of stuff, but the most famous was the records of the Three Kingdoms, which recorded the events of the Three Kingdoms period. Most of what we know about Chen comes from the official history of the Jin Dynasty, written over 300 years later in the Tang dynasty.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Records of the Three Kingdoms</h2><img src='resources/sanguozhi.jpeg' style="max-width:60%">
				<aside class="notes">Was an official history (note that these were produced at the behest of the government and were mainly aimed at aiding the ruler in proper governance. It was a 65 volume history that was divided into three parts, one for each of the Kingdoms. Structurally, the history is a collection of biographies of important people and the things that happened to them during their life. The history was later extended by Pei Songzhi. This was a fairly common way of structuring history at the time, although manyt did include section that was chronologically organized, this particular history did not.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Biography of Hua T'o</h2></section>
				<section><h2>The Chinese Novel</h2><aside class='notes'>There are a number of important characteristics that exist in Chinese novels of this time, and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms contains many of them. This is a chaptered novel, which was often read one chapter at a time. Each chapter begins with a couplet as a title that describes its contents, and each chapter ends with a formulaic phrase. We will discuss some of the functinos of these things as we continue to go through the noel. Note that sometimes the narrator of these works will interject</aside></section>
				<section><h2>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>Information from this history was rewritten into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It begins with events that precipitate the fall of the Han dynasty in the late 160s and gos through until the Jin dynasty reunifies the country in 280. The stories within the novel were not new (for obvious reasons), but they had been used for entertianment during the Tang and even earlier. In many cases these stories were told orally. In the 14th century a pinghua was published, which collected many of these tories. The romance was written in the very early Ming dynasty (probably toward the end of the 15th century, but was not published until 1522. There are multiple editions of the text, but the most famous was an edition edited and commented up by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang in the 1660s. They introduced significant edits, shortening the work, changing many of the poems, and making the book more anti Cao Cao.</aside></section>
				<section><h2>Luo Guanzhong 羅貫中</h2>
				<aside class='notes'>There isn't much that is really known about Luo, nor is it completely clear if he actually wrote the Romance. He most likely lived from 1330 to around 1400, altough there is some speculation he was alive a little bit before this. He also supposedly edited the Water Margin, which we will be reading later in class.</aside></section>

				<section><h2>Synopsis Chapters 1-20</h2><aside class="notes">A whole lot of stuff happens in the first twenty chapters, and it doesn't really slow down throughout. The text begins with the Yellow Turban Uprising (and we will talk a bit about some of the exact mechanics of this when we talk about chapter 1), goes through the quashing of the rebellion. After the quashing of the rebellion in the first chapter, the Eunuchs at court cause trouble by prevening Liu Bei from getting a promotion. When the emperor dies, the euchunhs try to influence the selection of the next emeperor. The regent tries to have the eunuchs executed by recriuting Dong Zhuo. Instaed, dong zhuo murders the regent and installs his own favored successor. The emperor is fully controlled by Dong Zhuo and previous emperor is killed. Lü Bu is theintroduced and kill his adoptive father to join with Dong Zhuo (Lu Bu will do stuff like thisthroughout, but he is really the most powerful warrior in the novel). Then Yuan Shu and Cao Cao decide that they need to kill DZ. The coalition, as we will see forms from many of the folks that fought the Yellow Turbans but they barely get along with each other. They fight and eventually manage to get to the capital, which DZ abandons. In the meantime Sun Jian discovers the imperial seal in the capitol and bails on the alliance, which falls apart. At this point there is really no one in charge of anything at all. Everyone declares war on everyone and things aren't looking so great. Eventually Lu Bu decides to Kill Dong Zhuo becuase of mutual interest in a woman. Cao cao manages to get hold of the Emperor that DZ had appointed but is harried by Lu Bu and defeated, which leads to CC exile in his homeland. An ambush is set up for him, but he manages to escape and regroup, eventually defeating Lu Bu in battle. Liu Bei has become a governor by then and eventually accepts LB as a subordinate (Zhang Fei doesn't like this). Liu Bei goves off fighting some folks, Zhang Fei gets really drunk, and Lu Bu captures Liu Bei's family and takes over. Meanwhile, Yuan Shu is given the imperial seal by Sun Ce to hold temporarily as sureity, the goes off and recruits troops and wins some battles, but Yuan Shu doesn't return the seal. Yua attacks Liu Bei but isnt' able to defeat him (he proposes an alliance with Lu Bu, but Lu sees the trick.). Eventually Yuan Shu declares himself emperor but Cao Cao and co unite against him and put him down. Cao Cao, having the emperor, orders Liu Bei to attack Lu Bu. LB escapes, and Cao starts to secure control of imperial command. But Cao Cao has clear designs on the throne itself and the formerly puppet emperor starts to make plans to take back control.</aside></section>
